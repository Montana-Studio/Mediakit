Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there''s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?

We’ve brought these experiences from your admin and re-created them right here on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Theme Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">Theme Directory</a> has a better browsing experience, with handy tabs where you can view featured, popular, and the latest themes. As with the theme experience in your admin, you can use the feature filter to browse for just the right theme for your WordPress website.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3572" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-1024x768.png" alt="theme-directory" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>Click on a theme to get more information about it, including shiny screenshots, ratings, and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3573" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-individual-1024x768.png" alt="theme-directory-individual" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>Konstantin Obenland <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/10/new-theme-directory/">posted a good overview</a> of everything involved with the theme directory overhaul and followed up with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/31/theme-directory-stats/">a post on improved statistics</a>.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">Plugin Directory</a> has a brand new theme that mirrors the experience in your WordPress admin, with a more visual experience, and better search and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3594" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/plugin-directory-1024x768.png" alt="plugin-directory" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>As well as a facelift, there are some great new features for you to play around with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorites – when you’re logged in to you WordPress.org account, this page gives you direct access to the plugins that you have favorited.</li>\n<li>Beta Testing – try out plugins where developers are experimenting with new features for WordPress.</li>\n<li>Search by plugin author – you can search for a plugin author using their username.</li>\n<li>Better statistics – listings now display the number of active installs so you can see how many people are actually using a plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/">overview of the new theme</a> was posted by Scott Reilly.</p>\n<h2>Better Statistics</h2>\n<p>We’ve made huge improvements to <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/stats/">our statistics</a>. This gives us more useful information about the WordPress versions people are using, their PHP version, and their MySQL version.</p>\n<p>Already these new statistics have provided us with useful insights into WordPress usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than 43% of all sites are running the latest version of WordPress. Previously, we thought only 10% of sites were up-to-date. By excluding sites that are no longer online we were able to improve these statistics.</li>\n<li>We were able to clear up the data around WordPress 3.0, bringing it more in line with expectations. This anomaly was a by-product of spammers.</li>\n<li>Only 15.9% of sites are using PHP 5.2, which is better than we thought.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the coming months we’ll be able to use these statistics to bring you new tools and improvements, and to make more informed decisions across the board.

At the beginning of 2015, Matt Mullenweg highlighted Jetpack as one of the most important tools in <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share" target="_blank">helping WordPress remain competitive</a> and preventing the decline of its market share.</p>\n<p>The team surrounding Jetpack is laser focused on adding compelling features that will help self-hosted sites get everything they need in one convenient pit stop. Whether or not you believe the future of WordPress is hinged on Jetpack&#8217;s success, there&#8217;s no doubt that the professionally-supported plugin has helped self-hosted sites to thrive, with much less effort required on the part of site administrators.</p>\n<p>With 36 modules currently available in the plugin and a never-ending support queue, the distributed team behind Jetpack meets up regularly to build teamwork and keep things running smoothly. At WordCamp London 2015, a good number of the newly expanded team met in person for the first time.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to sit down with a few Jetpack representatives, including team lead <a href="https://twitter.com/daljo628" target="_blank">George Stephanis</a>, support specialist <a href="https://twitter.com/carolynsonnek" target="_blank">Carolyn Sonnek</a>, and pit crew team member <a href="http://jes.se.com/" target="_blank">Jesse Friedman</a> to discuss what it takes to keep Jetpack going strong.</p>\n<h3>Managing the Jetpack Support Load</h3>\n<p>Since their last meetup in August, the Jetpack team has experienced quite a few shakeups. Automattic&#8217;s <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-parka-llc-the-creators-of-bruteprotect" target="_blank">BruteProtect acquisition</a> added five new team members to the pit crew, bringing their numbers to 10. The Jetpack Manage team, which ties into WordPress.com, has 10 members and is led by Beau Lebens. There are also 10 additional team members allocated for supporting Jetpack user happiness.</p>\n<p>Stephanis always tries to include someone from support, as they represent those who are on the front lines with users every day. The happiness engineers are also divided into sub-teams to manage a support queue that often adds up to several hundred tickets per day. Requests pour into an email inbox from the plugin itself, as well as the WordPress.org support forums.</p>\n<p>Jetpack team members are also active on Twitter and Facebook where they triage requests and help to move users to a more traditional support avenue. The happiness engineers are currently working on a quicker turnaround for support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Right now our goal is to get under 12 hours, and then once we hit that goal, we&#8217;re going to go to five hours, and then on to 1 hour someday,&#8221; Sonnek said. If you take a look at the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack" target="_blank">support forums</a>, you&#8217;ll find that nearly all of the issues are resolved or in process, which is a rarity for WordPress.org plugins. It takes 10 team members to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>Automattic is aware of the number of people currently using Jetpack but will not be disclosing that information publicly. &#8220;We use those numbers internally for reference for how we are doing, or to see if there has been some change that has resulted in an uptake of new connections or something along those lines,&#8221; Stephanis said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end it&#8217;s a number, and a number without context is very easy to take out of context. <span class="pullquote alignleft">Instead of dwelling on the numbers, we&#8217;re much more interested in what adoption looks like.</span>&#8221; He said that the total number is comparable to the million installs reported by WordPress.org but is probably somewhat less if you account for test sites and hosting partnerships where the plugin is automatically installed but not yet active.</p>\n<h3>Jetpack Focus for 2015: Iterating and Polishing of Current Features</h3>\n<p>For the past few years the Jetpack team has managed a unique balancing act of prioritizing support while fixing bugs and tackling new features at the same time. Many recent releases have introduced new modules, but the team is switching gears in 2015 to focus on keeping the ride smooth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our focus for the next year is largely going to be on iterating and putting the next bit of spit and polish on features that are already in,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;A lot of the things we&#8217;ve launched need a v2; they need a second pass on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This new focus will be a change as compared to the previous breakneck speed with which the team was cranking out new modules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are couple of minor things that other teams are working on that will probably get rolled out to WordPress.com and will probably get synced down to Jetpack as well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s no large ticket features that we&#8217;re currently focusing to get into Jetpack and get launched.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is very much a year focused on building up the team, building up familiarity with our internal processes and cultures, and addressing some long-standing technical debt that we&#8217;ve been kind of swamped with paying down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But now with the resources we currently have, it&#8217;s much easier to focus on the core product offering and how to explain that,&#8221; Stephanis said.</p>\n<h3>Pushing for Goals Over Deadlines</h3>\n<p>Stephanis has been leading Jetpack releases for awhile, but recently the team has started rotating release leads in preparation for his upcoming paternity leave. I asked him if he still feels the weight of pushing out code to millions of users at release time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just thinking &#8211;  What edge cases have I missed? Have I forgotten to do something? Have I updated the translations? What if we&#8217;re not compatible with some other plugin?  What if there&#8217;s a name space conflict and we white screen some sites?&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a massive user base using a myriad of different themes and plugins, there&#8217;s always the chance for some unforeseen conflict. The support team has to be prepared to handle that.</p>\n<p>However, Stephanis believes the many problems with releases can be prevented by making sure you&#8217;re never in a rush.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re forcing it through to get it out super quick, you&#8217;re not giving your subconscious the time to turn things over in its own time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying intentionally slow down the development process, but <span class="pullquote alignleft">making sure you&#8217;re never overly rushed by deadlines is one of my best ways to ensure that we&#8217;re not having oops moments</span> or shipping something and then two hours later go &#8216;Oh we forgot the&#8230;''&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of this approach, the team focuses on goals and testing more than meeting an arbitrary release schedule.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We set goals more than deadlines,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s nice to have deadlines and goals but if you&#8217;re overly concerned about the deadline, the quality can slip. We make sure we&#8217;re not shipping anything unless we&#8217;re really comfortable with it, we&#8217;re confident, and we&#8217;ve tested it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team aims to do at least a one-week translation freeze before releases and generally catches a good deal of bugs during the freeze.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a fantastic Jetpack beta group that we pass releases out to and explain everything new that&#8217;s coming,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of the edge cases they turn up just blow my mind.&#8221; Having that cushion of time to focus on compatibility and cross testing is essential to mitigating Jetpack&#8217;s conflicts with other plugins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">Very small issues become very big issues when you&#8217;re running at scale with millions of users</span>,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;If something is only hitting one tenth of one percent, guess what, that&#8217;s a couple thousand users now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With an ever growing user base, the cost of a mistake or conflict gets even more expensive in terms of support. This is where the Jetpack team has learned that not rushing really pays off. The goal, in the end, is not about hitting a release date but rather providing a smooth experience with the release.</p>\n<h3>Overcoming Negative Perceptions of Jetpack</h3>\n<p>One of the constant struggles for the Jetpack team is addressing the negative perceptions of the plugin, especially criticism from the development community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are still a lot of folks who don&#8217;t understand what we&#8217;re actually trying to accomplish,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;I occasionally get questions like, &#8216;With as many things as Jetpack is doing, how are individual plugin authors meant to in any way compete against this?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The answer to that is we do a lot of general things aimed at raising the tide that lifts all the ships, but we don&#8217;t go in any way in depth. For example, I don&#8217;t think the contact form module in Jetpack has in any way hindered the sales of Gravity Forms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Developers still have the ability to pick one aspect and go incredibly in depth on it &#8211; yes, we have related posts, but if someone wants to do a plugin that just does related posts and really knocks it out of the park, we&#8217;ll be able to get folks started on the idea of it. Then they&#8217;ll get comfortable and will be much more willing to move to a premium version that they find elsewhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Stephanis also emphasized Jetpack&#8217;s extensibility. Plugin authors are even at liberty to utilize the WordPress.com infrastructure while extending Jetpack features. Despite having 36 different modules, the goal has never been to add every possible feature.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things we fight perception-wise is the concept that Jetpack is bloated,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;Which is an easy thing to think when you see what appears to be 30 some different plugins that you to turn on and off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When they all tie together with the common core, one plugin can be just one line of code or one plugin could be humongous. It&#8217;s very easy to fall into the idea of: &#8216;I turn off a plugin and that&#8217;s going to make my site go faster, right?&#8217; But the fact of the matter is that everything we do in WordPress and life is always going to be a matter of trade offs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you do something else, it&#8217;s going to affect your site in some fashion. Just by the very fact that you&#8217;re adding some level of complexity. It&#8217;s more of a question of if you want this feature what&#8217;s the best trade off you can get for it. Sam ran a <a href="https://bruteprotect.com/the-jetpack-bloat-myth/" target="_blank">couple</a> <a href="http://bruteprotect.com/jetpack-bloat-myth-followup-more-data/" target="_blank">comparisons</a> and published them on the group blog comparing our commenting form and several of our other features to WP plugins. In comparison, we wind up coming out a little bit ahead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The download size of Jetpack, currently at 8.2MB, is often a concern for many users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The code base gets a lot of misunderstanding,&#8221; Stephanis said. &#8220;The translations are about 2/3 of it and the Custom CSS module includes a megabyte in and of itself, because we include some JavaScript and CSS to make it pretty as you&#8217;re editing it, SASS and Less precompilers, the CSS sanitization library, all of which for the vast majority of page views isn&#8217;t even loaded.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the moment, three quarters of Jetpack sites are using English, which means that two thirds of the download size is irrelevant to three quarters of Jetpack users. Getting translations on demand is a major goal for the plugin, but the team has to work with WordPress.org to make it happen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are waiting on support from WordPres.org to let us use a GlotPress instance to manage our translation flow and then it&#8217;s just a quick switch to start serving it up on their end,&#8221; Stephanis said.</p>\n<p>Until that is resolved, the cost of supporting a global user base will continue to be an extra 5MB on the initial download. Apart from some vocal opposition from developers, most Jetpack users do not seem to mind the size of the download or the number of modules. The features it provides in one package are too compelling and convenient for most of the plugin&#8217;s users to notice the download size.</p>\n<p>Jetpack also gives self-hosted sites access to the infrastructure available on WordPress.com for features that might otherwise create a toll on budget hosting providers, such as related posts and the free Photon CDN. However, Stephanis believes that the quality of maintenance and support are the most compelling reasons to use Jetpack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest gripes most folks have with the WordPress.org plugin repository is that there are so many abandoned plugins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These are plugins that either have bugs and never get attention or plugins that, if something breaks, you can never get support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By far the biggest advantage and the best reason to use Jetpack is the fact that we have 20 active developers between Beau&#8217;s team and the pit crew itself, and an active crew of about 10 support folks that are daily focused on enriching the experience, fixing any issues that come up. That, by far, to me is the biggest selling point, the biggest advantage over using 30 different plugins where the code quality may be more questionable.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 22:22:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Matt: John Oliver meets Snowden";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44940";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/john-oliver-meets-snowden/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:221:"<p>John Oliver is pretty much always fun to watch, but you should especially send this episode to everyone you know, it&#8217;s important for people to see and understand it.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:30:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Matt: Apple Watch Horror Story";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44945";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/apple-watch-horror-story/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:735:"<p>Read through <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/a-horror-story-constructed-entirely-from-actual-115916627734.html">this amazing horror story constructed of actual sentences (with links) from reviews of the Apple Watch</a>.

The chart takes a little while to get used to as it&#8217;s an alternate way of browsing directories and files. Click any of the arches to browse deeper into a directory. Clicking the center circle will take you back a directory.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SunburstDiskUsage.png" rel="prettyphoto[41934]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41980" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SunburstDiskUsage.png?resize=888%2C798" alt="Suburst Disk Usage" /></a>One thing I noticed during testing, is that there&#8217;s no visual indication when you click on an arch. There&#8217;s also a delay when selecting an arch since it takes time to render the chart. There might be a bigger impact on performance for sites with large file and directory structures.</p>\n<p>In future updates, I&#8217;d like to see a list of shortcuts such as, largest file, largest directory, etc. This would make it quick to view pertinent information and give users an idea on how the chart works. I&#8217;d also like to see improvements to speed and performance. Disk Usage Sunburst serves its purpose and works fine on WordPress 4.2.

As of January 2015, the app&#8217;s user base has grown to more than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_communities_with_more_than_100_million_active_users" target="_blank">700 million active users</a>, making it the third largest social network on the planet.</p>\n<p>Last year very few WordPress sharing plugins prioritized adding WhatsApp, despite its enormous popularity. This has gradually improved in 2015, as more than two dozen social plugins on WordPress.org now include a WhatsApp sharing button.</p>\n<p>A new plugin released today brings WhatsApp sharing capabilities to Jetpack, which surprisingly doesn&#8217;t include this by default. A <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/755" target="_blank">ticket</a> was opened on Jetpack&#8217;s GitHub account to request this feature, but Jetpack representatives recommended that the service be added as a separate plugin.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/whatsapp-jetpack-button/" target="_blank">WhatsApp Sharing Button for Jetpack</a> was created by Brazilian WordPress developer <a href="http://valeriosouza.com.br/" target="_blank">Valerio Souza</a>. It works seamlessly with the sharing module&#8217;s drag-and-drop configuration and uses the same design style as the other buttons.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/whatsapp-sharing.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41939]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/whatsapp-sharing.jpg?resize=973%2C560" alt="whatsapp-sharing" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41942" /></a></p>\n<p>After testing the plugin I discovered that the WhatsApp sharing button is intuitively hidden on the desktop version. Users will only see it if viewing a post from a mobile device, including smartphones and tablets. If you don&#8217;t see the button on mobile, make sure you meet the plugin&#8217;s minimum requirements: PHP 5.4+, MySQL 5.5+, WordPress 3.8+.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see Jetpack add more sharing options for messaging apps. These social networks generally provide a more personal avenue for sharing a post, as opposed to publicly broadcasting to Twitter or Facebook. As an enthusiastic <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank">Telegram</a> user, I&#8217;d love to see a similar plugin created for it.</p>\n<p>A service with 700+ million active users is one social network you can no longer afford to ignore when it comes to sharing, especially if your blog enjoys a global audience. WhatsApp users&#8217; geographical distribution is heaviest in <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/02/whatsapp-rules-rest-world/" target="_blank">India, Brazil, and Mexico</a>, three emerging markets where smartphones usage is just now starting to explode. Installing the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/whatsapp-jetpack-button/" target="_blank">WhatsApp Sharing Button for Jetpack</a> plugin may help your posts reach more readers in other parts of the world.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 22:57:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: Automattic Sponsors Let’s Encrypt Initiative";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41589";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://wptavern.com/automattic-sponsors-lets-encrypt-initiative";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4401:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lets-encrypt.png" rel="prettyphoto[41589]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lets-encrypt.png?resize=650%2C333" alt="lets-encrypt" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41915" /></a></p>\n<p>Last November the <a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> announced <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/certificate-authority-encrypt-entire-web" target="_blank">Let’s Encrypt</a>, a new free and open certificate authority for the public. The initiative aims to make trusted certificates available to anyone at no cost.</p>\n<p>The idea behind Let&#8217;s Encrypt is to transition as many domains as possible from HTTP to HTTPS by providing a virtually painless one-click enrollment process during the server&#8217;s native installation.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>The Let&#8217;s Encrypt certificate authority is set to launch mid-2015. Last month, Automattic <a href="https://twitter.com/letsencrypt/status/578230030876086272" target="_blank">joined</a> Mozilla, Cisco, EFF and several other organizations as a major sponsor of the initiative. I spoke with <a href="https://barry.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Barry Abrahamson</a>, Chief Systems Wrangler at Automattic, to find out if the company has any plans beyond helping to fund the effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any concrete plans past the sponsorship at this point, but we hope to help bring SSL support to as many WordPress sites as we can,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Last year Automattic <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-to-implement-ssl-for-all-subdomains-joins-the-fight-against-mass-surveillance" target="_blank">implemented SSL for all *.wordpress.com subdomains</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.resetthenet.org/" target="_blank">Reset the Net</a> campaign against mass surveillance. The company&#8217;s Akismet product recently <a href="http://wptavern.com/akismet-improves-user-privacy-by-encrypting-api-calls" target="_blank">transitioned all calls to its API to use SSL</a> in order to better secure commenter data.</p>\n<p>While many larger WordPress sites have made the move to SSL, the average self-hosted WordPress user is likely to have a tricky time setting it up. That&#8217;s why initiatives like &#8220;Let&#8217;s Encrypt&#8221; are so important.</p>\n<p>However, skeptics aren&#8217;t fully convinced that the new certificate authority will make the web any safer from prying government eyes. Privacy advocate Alexander Hanff wrote a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141120073425-26662417-why-i-won-t-be-using-let-s-encrypt-and-recommend-other-not-to-also" target="_blank">post</a> explaining why he believes that a new super certificate authority will paint a target on those who use it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Certificate Authorities are the weakest link in the digital security chain. They have the power to issue special master keys (for want of better phrase) which allows a third party to pretend to be someone they are not. In essence, this means if compelled by a secret court order, a certificate authority can provide special certificates to any intelligence agency or other law enforcement body, which will allow them to masquerade as someone else (your bank, Facebook, Google &#8211; anyone who uses that certificate authority for their SSL certificates)</p></blockquote>\n<p>He notes that secret court orders are almost always accompanied by a gag order so that the certificate authority cannot reveal that they have issued special certificates to the government. If the government has unfettered access to &#8220;super master keys&#8221; for thousands of domains, expedited by a new free certificate authority aiming to &#8220;encrypt the entire web,&#8221; then certificate based encryption is rendered worthless.</p>\n<p>The Let&#8217;s Encrypt initiative is positioned to have a radical impact on the number of encrypted sites on the web. Bringing encryption to the masses means that more people will be better protected against attacks such as account hijacking and identity theft. However, if you use the new free certificate authority, it&#8217;s important to understand that your communications may not be secure from government surveillance. Free SSL certificates for everyone will come at a price.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 10:10:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: Get Email Alerts for Security Vulnerabilities in Your WordPress Plugins";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41867";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://wptavern.com/get-email-alerts-for-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-wordpress-plugins";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5115:"<p>WordPress users have been subject to a rash of plugin vulnerabilities over the past couple of months.

Rachel Baker, one of the lead developers of the WP REST API plugin says, &#8220;The release fixes a serious information disclosure vulnerability, which allowed for unpublished content and post revisions to be retrieved via the REST API.&#8221; The security vulnerability affects versions 1.2.0 and earlier.</p>\n<p>The security update was coordinated by the REST API and the WordPress core security team. The WordPress core security team is pushing out automatic updates for each branch. There are packages for 1.2.1, 1.1.3, 1.0.2, 0.9.2, and 0.8.2.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using WP REST API version 1.2.0 or earlier, don&#8217;t wait for the auto update. Instead, manually update as soon as possible. You can update by browsing to Dashboard &#8211; Updates in the WordPress backend, download it from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/">the plugin directory</a> (<a href="https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/json-rest-api.latest-stable.zip">zip</a>), or pull it <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tags">from GitHub.</a></p>\n<p>In addition to the WP REST API plugin, <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-contact-forms/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-contact-forms/">Custom Contact Forms</a> and <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/reactor-core/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/reactor-core/">Reactor: Core, </a>have pushed out security updates related to the WP REST API vulnerability.

As far as donation plugins go, this one is making a big splash with its 0% commission charge approach. Any site using the plugin can collect 100% of the donations given, as opposed to online donation sites that generally keep a portion of funds raised.</p>\n<p><a href="https://givewp.com/" target="_blank">Give</a> aims to &#8220;Democratize Generosity,&#8221; a nod to the mission of WordPress. The plugin was created to empower causes and non-profits with the ability to host their own donation forms, easily manage reporting and customize emails directly within the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>Give supports the creation of flexible forms, so that you can accept payments of different amounts or allow users to set a custom amount. Developers can also easily add custom form fields.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/give-plugin-screenshot.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41772]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/give-plugin-screenshot.jpg?resize=779%2C469" alt="give-plugin-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41841" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin is built by the folks behind <a href="http://wordimpress.com/" target="_blank">WordImpress</a>. Co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc" target="_blank">Matt Cromwell</a> said that they naturally fell into the donations niche after many frustrating experiences supporting non-profits without donation-specific tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Devin and I both worked with non-profits before WordImpress and struggled with donations every time,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;One client we still serve manages donations with a mess of WooCommerce/Donation Extensions/Subscription Extension/QuickCheckout. Small bugs in one make the whole thing break down. Plus, you don&#8217;t get good reporting on total donations, or donations per donor, and you have to tweak the language strings everywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite a plethora of donation plugins on WordPress.org and donation features integrated into some of the major e-commerce options, the Give team saw an opportunity for a more solid, streamlined approach for collecting and managing donations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We felt like this was a space that really needed a robust &#8211; but best practices &#8211; solution, and Woo and EDD and GForms were just not made for this purpose,&#8221; Cromwell said.</p>\n<h3>Adopting the Freemium Model: Free Core Plugin + Commercial Extensions</h3>\n<p>The team behind Give hopes to monetize the plugin by selling <a href="https://givewp.com/addons" target="_blank">add-ons</a>, the same model used successfully by Easy Digital Downloads, WooCommerce, and other products. Creating a free core product with commercial extensions is becoming an increasingly more popular way of making a business out of developing open source software.</p>\n<p>The core plugin currently supports offline payments and the PayPal Standard payment gateway. Commercial add-ons are available for others, including Stripe, WePay, Authorize.net, Paymill, and PayPal Pro. Offline payments can be useful for sites that are taking registration at events or for people who would prefer to mail a check.</p>\n<p>The Give plugin actually borrows a good deal of its code base from Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and its gateways, which gave the team a bit of a head start. Trimming it down and writing donation-specific code for the core and gateways was the bulk of the effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All together, development of the core plugin, current add-ons, and the website has taken Devin and I roughly 6 months,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Of course that&#8217;s while maintaining our current sales and support of our existing products and initiating a few other new avenues we&#8217;re headed into (specifically themes).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Give plugin team plans to create themes for non-profits that will work seamlessly with the Give plugin. &#8220;Themes are a great market, but we want to make sure we do it right, so we&#8217;re taking our time there,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Cromwell reports that sales for the add-ons have been slow so far, and WordPress.org shows less than 10 active installations using the plugin. The team is hopeful that the core plugin will gain more users and that in the future they will be able to transition Give development and support into more of a full-time effort.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe it will take off well,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;We think of our business as setting up &#8216;tent poles&#8217;. For WordImpress, QuickCheckout has been our best tent pole. But now we&#8217;re hoping that Give will become the biggest tent pole that helps raise all others. It&#8217;s another piece of our brand that we&#8217;re really proud of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team behind Give partnered with <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/" target="_blank">Girl Develop It</a> to support women interested in learning how to code. If you want to see how the plugin works, check out the <a href="https://givewp.com/demo/" target="_blank">live demo</a> built to support their partnership. There you can see different variations of the forms and custom form fields in action.

The 45-question survey ran for just two weeks in February and the site was able to collect results from more than 26,000 participants.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Stack Overflow survey respondents do not represent a perfect cross section of all developers worldwide, and the overview clearly states the results are skewed by selection bias and language bias, among other biases. However, the site does reach a massive audience of developers, with 32 million visits per month, 25 million of which are return visitors.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of respondents were male (92.1%) who describe their profession as &#8220;Full-stack web developer&#8221; (32.4%), the largest section, followed by student (13.6%), back-end web developer (10.1%), and mobile developer (9.1%).</p>\n<p>WordPress was highlighted as one of the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#tech-super" target="_blank">most dreaded technologies</a> of those surveyed, trailing Visual Basic and Salesforce.

WordPress&#8217; unwavering commitment to backwards compatibility is also a major turn off for many developers. However, WordPress usage stats, currently at <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">23.7&amp; of all websites</a>, continue to climb higher due to the project&#8217;s deep commitment to its users.</p>\n<h3>Useful Bits for Employers and Job Hunters</h3>\n<p>The Stack Overflow survey may be heavily skewed towards a specific range of developers with similar backgrounds, but the results contain quite a bit of useful information for employers looking to hire developers and for individuals in search of a job.</p>\n<p>For example, the results revealed that &#8220;50% of developers say working remote is at least somewhat important.&#8221; The overview advises employers to strongly consider offering the ability to work remotely. <strong>&#8220;Note to companies trying to hire: if your job listing doesn&#8217;t include remote, you could be cutting your possible applicant pool in half.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Stack Overflow is also able to interpret that data in interesting ways based on users&#8217; experience points on the site. They found that those with the most experience points said that being able to work remotely was non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>Based on 16,522 responses, the results indicate that the average developer spends 7+ hours per week coding on the side. &#8220;70% of respondents reported that they spend 2 or more hours per week programming either as a hobby or working on open source software. 20% of respondents spend more than 10 hours programming away from work.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/side-projects.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41651]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/side-projects.jpg?resize=715%2C373" alt="side-projects" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41803" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer hunting for a job and you&#8217;re not spending your free time contributing to open source projects or building your own software, your resume and experience may not be as attractive as others who are active on projects outside of work.</p>\n<p>The survey also provides a comprehensive breakdown of compensation by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-complang" target="_blank">technology</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-geo" target="_blank">purchasing power</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-remote" target="_blank">remote status</a>, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-compensation-so" target="_blank">Stack Overflow reputation</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/compensation.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41651]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/compensation.jpg?resize=713%2C605" alt="compensation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41806" /></a></p>\n<p>Compensation by purchasing power indicates that Ukraine is the top place for developers to live and work, followed by South Africa, USA, Australia, and Russia.

In <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/wordpress-and-windows-azure/">a post </a>on the WordPress.com VIP blog, Matt Mullenweg explained why it&#8217;s a good move.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress and Windows Azure probably aren’t the first two things you’d think of together. WordPress has been free and open source software from the very beginning, Windows not so much, but we’ve always supported as many platforms as possible and for at least 4 years now you could run WP on Windows and IIS (Internet Information Services).</p>\n<p>Choice and competition are great for spurring innovation and better for users and I believe open source software is a good thing even if it’s on a proprietary platform. (Just like we have an open source <a href="http://iphone.wordpress.org/">iPhone application</a>, or encourage people to use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> on Windows.)</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Supporting the WordPress Community</h2>\n<p>Since 2009, Microsoft has sponsored several WordCamps, meetups, and WordPress specific events.

The Powerbeats 2 are light, have great battery life (they claim 6 hours, that feels about right), stay in place even when running in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Houston#Summer">the Houston heat</a>, charge fast, and as a bonus they look cool. (Beats has always been great about that.) The sound? They&#8217;re bad, but good at it. There&#8217;s basically no isolation so you can hear traffic and things around you at lower volumes, which is actually a bonus, and if you turn up the volume they get loud enough to drown other stuff out. Buy these for the function, not the sound quality, and you can pick them up from any Best Buy kiosk in the airport or Apple Store if you lose or forget them, so they&#8217;re pretty ubiquitous.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-44930" src="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2-784x740.jpg" alt="71mNNnOhCKL._SL1500_-2" width="360" height="340" /></a>I heard about the Sennheisers from <a href="http://carlhancock.com/">Carl Hancock</a> who tried them and gave them a high recommendation. I had trouble finding them but there was a pair local to me at <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/">B&amp;H in New York</a> so I got them delivered and I was immediately impressed with them. They&#8217;re better than my <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/10/beats-studio-wireless-vs-samsung-level-over/">previous wireless over-ear recommendation the Samsung Level Over</a> in every way: sound, size, compatibility, aesthetics, usability, noise canceling.</p>\n<p>The sound is the best I&#8217;ve heard from wireless headphones so far. Just the right balance. The noise canceling apparently uses 4 different mics and I&#8217;ve found it more than sufficient on dozens of plane rides, including passing the noisy baby test. My only complaint is they don&#8217;t &#8220;grip&#8221; my ears as much, so some sound leaks in that way. They fold up to be pretty small, and I just toss them in my backpack. <a href="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-44931 alignleft" src="https://ma.tt/files/2015/04/81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2-784x740.jpg" alt="81FYeTRjv4L._SL1500_-2" width="252" height="238" /></a>The battery goes <em>forever</em>, or as they claim 22 hours. You really forget to charge these things for a while and they still have plenty of juice. The volume and other controls actually work with the iPhone, and bluetooth calls have sounded great and people can actually hear me. Only downside is they have basically a proprietary connection for their 1/8th inch cable, so you have ta carry that around, but they charge with standard micro-USB.

Peter is a web developer from the Land of the Danes. He is the creator of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> and a huge travel addict, bringing his work along with him as he goes.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This article is based on a few ideas, thoughts and opinions I have about Git and WordPress. There is still no de-facto standard for how these things are dealt with in WordPress and I think it is our responsibility, as a community, to have discussions about them. These are my opinions and I would love to hear yours as well.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get right to it.</p>\n<h2>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</h2>\n<p>I have ranted about the subject of repository structure before and I have strong opinions about it. In my opinion there is one &#8211; and only one &#8211; way to structure Git repositories in a WordPress context. That one way is the one-package / one-repository approach. Let me explain why.</p>\n<p>While working on WP Pusher, I have seen many different approaches to structuring Git repositories. Two approaches are especially common, and, in my opinion, equally bad.</p>\n<p>The first one is Git-it-all, where everything, including WordPress core, plugins and themes are put under version control. The other one, and more common, is <code>wp-content</code>-under-version-control. I say that both of them are equally bad, because no matter what, you are going to have a lot of 3rd party code included in your Git repository, which quickly becomes a mess. Every time WordPress or one of your plugins or themes ships a new update, you will have to somehow deal with it within your version control system.</p>\n<p>The argument for having WordPress itself under version control is most often to lock down the version of the code. This seems a bit redundant to me, since WordPress is already developed using version control (SVN) and comes with a version number for each update. Why would you need to manage that yourself when it is already managed for you? Today, <a href="https://davidwinter.me/install-and-manage-wordpress-with-composer/" target="_blank">installing WordPress with Composer</a> is super easy and then you can control your version from the <code>composer.json</code> file. There are no excuses. Do not include WordPress in your Git repository.</p>\n<p>The second approach, <code>wp-content</code>-under-version-control, is often chosen as an easy way of deploying multiple plugins that might depend on each other. Still, I am not buying it. Having 5, 10, or even 20 Git repositories in your <code>wp-content</code> directory is really not an issue. Also, if your plugins depends on each other, take a look at must-use plugins.</p>\n<p>So here is the deal: <strong>You need to treat each of your packages (be it a plugin or a theme) with respect.</strong> You need to give each of them their own Git repository. They are their own entities and needs to be separated. Keeping them locked up together makes it impossible to share code across projects. It is the way Git is supposed to work, it is the way Composer is supposed to work, and it is even the way WordPress itself works.</p>\n<h2>To Ignore, Or Not To Ignore</h2>\n<p>Yes, that is the question and I do not have the answer. I am, of course, talking about the <code>.gitignore</code> file. The file that tells Git which files and directories to exclude from version control. Actually, the real question is: Should you precompile your dependencies before shipping your plugin, or not? (I will focus on PHP dependencies, since I do not know enough about front-end things.)</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, you would never ship something like Composer dependencies with your package. It would be up to the user to compile and fetch those dependencies that fit their specific environment. That is the whole point of dependency management tools. However, in WordPress, there is absolutely no sane way to handle these PHP dependencies. So if you are shipping a WordPress plugin that relies on 3rd party dependencies, I would say &#8220;ship it all&#8221;, even though it feels very wrong and awkward.</p>\n<p>This is <strong><em>bad</em></strong>, though, because what happens when Mailchimp for WordPress ships with one Composer package in v1.0.0 and WP Pusher ships with the same package but v2.0.0? Oh, the horror. The plugin that is loaded first will get to autoload its classes. The others will not (since it would result in a &#8220;class exists&#8221; fatal error). I probably do not need to explain why this is bad.</p>\n<p>As a WordPress developer, you can try to mitigate this by making sure that the functionality you rely on is actually available at runtime, but this is not optimal. However, I really think this is WordPress&#8217; responsibility. We cannot do PHP without using 3rd party code. That would be stupid. So as I said: No clear answer. I guess it just depends.</p>\n<h2>Exporting Repositories aka Zippin&#8217;</h2>\n<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/2jzp6k/i_dont_need_your_tests_in_my_production/" target="_blank">someone on Reddit</a> proposed that people start to include a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in their repositories, containing export instructions for Git to use when archiving repositories (zipping them). Basically, by specifying it in your <code>.gitattributes</code> file, you can make Git ignore files that you only need for development.</p>\n<p>The Reddit thread was specifically targeting authors of packages distributed with Composer, but we can use this trick as well. If you exclude files from exports, they will not appear in the zip archives that you can download from GitHub or Bitbucket. This is nifty, especially if you use a tool like my <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> to move files from Git to WordPress, since it can drastically minimize the size of the archive files. No need to ship files such as assets, that are already compiled, and unit tests to end users.</p>\n<p>Here is the <code>.gitattributes</code> file for WP Pusher:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; light: true; title: ; notranslate">/features       export-ignore\n/apache-ci.conf export-ignore\n/behat.yml      export-ignore\n/circle.yml     export-ignore\n/composer.json  export-ignore\n/composer.lock  export-ignore</pre>\n<p>Before I knew about this trick, I manually deleted these files before shipping the plugin. Now it is done automatically.</p>\n<p>There you go. Just a few things I want you to think about and consider if you are a WordPress developer using Git. Thanks for reading along.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 18:15:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Persistent XSS Vulnerability Discovered in WP Super Cache Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41702";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://wptavern.com/persistent-xss-vulnerability-discovered-in-wp-super-cache-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2905:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-super-cache.png" rel="prettyphoto[41702]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-super-cache.png?resize=739%2C296" alt="wp-super-cache" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41755" /></a></p>\n<p>The security team at Sucuri has issued an <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-persistent-xss-in-wp-super-cache.html" target="_blank">advisory</a> for WordPress users who have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/" target="_blank">WP Super Cache</a> plugin activated on their sites. The popular caching plugin contains a dangerous persistent XSS vulnerability that was promptly patched in its 1.4.4 release.</p>\n<p>Sucuri ranks the risk as &#8220;Dangerous&#8221; with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD:_Risk_assessment_model" target="_blank">DREAD</a> score of 8/10. Exploiting the vulnerability is relatively easy for an attacker intent on injecting a backdoor. Sucuri breaks down the technical details of the threat as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using this vulnerability, an attacker using a carefully crafted query could insert malicious scripts to the plugin’s cached file listing page. As this page requires a valid nonce in order to be displayed, a successful exploitation would require the site’s administrator to have a look at that particular section, manually.</p>\n<p>When executed, the injected scripts could be used to perform a lot of other things like adding a new administrator account to the site, injecting backdoors by using WordPress theme edition tools, etc.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WP Super Cache is currently in use on more than a million WordPress sites, according to WordPress.org. If someone is looking to exploit the vulnerability in particular, there would be no shortage of sites to prey upon.</p>\n<p>In the recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/fbi-warns-of-isil-defacement-attacks-on-wordpress-sites" target="_blank">defacement attacks propagated by ISIL sympathists against WordPress sites</a>, hackers have been capitalizing on the <a href="http://wptavern.com/zero-day-vulnerability-discovered-in-fancybox-for-wordpress-plugin" target="_blank">recent vulnerability found in the Fancy Box for WordPress plugin</a>. With just 100,000+ active installations, potentially vulnerably Fancy Box plugin users come in at a small fraction of those affected by the WP Super Cache security issue.</p>\n<p>Short of forcing an automatic plugin update on users, WordPress.org has no way of indicating that one particular plugin update may be more imperative than other routine updates. That&#8217;s why the best practice for site administrators is to keep tabs on your installations and set aside time to update extensions as part of your routine. If you&#8217;re using WP Super Cache, you are advised to update as soon as possible.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 16:30:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Matt: Giving Back to Open Source";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44891";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/giving-back-to-open-source/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:372:"<blockquote><p>Getting out of our ocean to explore the islands of open source is one of the best ways that we can expand our horizons, strengthen our skill sets, and build better relationships.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pippin on <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/giving-back-for-the-future-of-open-source/">why giving back to open source has made his company better</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 04:00:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: FBI Warns of ISIL Defacement Attacks on WordPress Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41707";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/fbi-warns-of-isil-defacement-attacks-on-wordpress-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4587:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41707]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg?resize=1024%2C514" alt="photo credit: Lock - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-40187" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58441544@N00/2660230441">Lock</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>The FBI issued a public service announcement today, <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/media/2015/150407-1.aspx" target="_blank">warning concerning WordPress website attacks</a> being carried out by individuals sympathetic to the Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL) a.k.a. Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shams (ISIS). The perpetrators of these attacks are defacing sites across various platforms such as news organizations, businesses, government sites, and religious institutions.</p>\n<p>Last month the would-be terrorists gained infamy by <a href="http://wptavern.com/hackers-hijack-fancybox-plugin-to-deface-wordpress-sites-with-isis-propaganda" target="_blank">hijacking the Fancybox Plugin vulnerability in order to deface sites with ISIS propaganda</a>. This particular vulnerability allows malware (or any random script/content) to be added to the vulnerable site and was most recently identified as the entry point for the hackers who injected iframes with ISIS messages.</p>\n<p>A patch exists for the vulnerability and those affected can easily remove the plugin as an alternative. However, many WordPress users are either ignorant of the security issue or indifferent. The FBI&#8217;s announcement serves to warn users of the cost and inconvenience associated with this kind of attack:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although the defacements demonstrate low-level hacking sophistication, they are disruptive and often costly in terms of lost business revenue and expenditures on technical services to repair infected computer systems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement cited multiple plugin vulnerabilities as a security risk to WordPress users but did not identify the plugins for which patches are currently available. Technical details of the brief are limited to a generalized list of consequences should a vulnerable site get hacked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could result in an attacker gaining unauthorized access, bypassing security restrictions, injecting scripts, and stealing cookies from computer systems or network servers. An attacker could install malicious software; manipulate data; or create new accounts with full user privileges for future Web site exploitation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since these are low level hackers exploiting the most basic types of vulnerabilities, they are not targeting specific sites but rather knocking down any open door they can find. The announcement notes that all of the victims of the defacements share common WordPress plugin vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The FBI does not believe that these attacks are actually coming from members of ISIL but instead are coming from hackers using the organization&#8217;s name as a vehicle for greater exposure.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The FBI assesses that the perpetrators are not members of the ISIL terrorist organization. These individuals are hackers using relatively unsophisticated methods to exploit technical vulnerabilities and are utilizing the ISIL name to gain more notoriety than the underlying attack would have otherwise garnered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement concludes with a list of general resources for hardening WordPress and identifying vulnerabilities, but the recommendations are vague and non-specific. The best thing that you can do to keep your site safe from these continuing attacks is to make sure you are running the latest version of WordPress. Log in to your sites and update all of your themes and plugins. If you&#8217;re using any commercial plugins or themes, make sure to check for updates in case you are not automatically notified.</p>\n<p>All of the vulnerabilities referenced in the FBI warning already have patches, and all you need to do is update your plugins.

So, technically there isn&#8217;t much change to contrast.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A closer look at the HEX changes side-by-side shows the subtle evolution from dusty greys/blues to a more true blue hue:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-admin-colors.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41644]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-admin-colors.jpg?resize=741%2C594" alt="wp-admin-colors" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41675" /></a></p>\n<p>I asked Baeta what his response would be to those who, like one commenter on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2015/04/05/default-admin-color-scheme-update/#comment-24585" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, see the new color scheme as looking &#8220;too bluish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a perception game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The technical reality is the change is incredibly subtle, but depending on your monitor calibration and the way your eyes see color, you&#8217;ll see more/less blue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let me give you an example of a specific hue breakdown &#8211; the main sidebar gray:</p>\n<p><strong>before:</strong>  rgb(51,51,51)<br />\n<strong>after:</strong> rgb(50,55,60)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Each channel goes  0-255 &#8211; so you can see how subtle the change is,&#8221; Baeta explained.</p>\n<p>Feedback from contributors on the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31234" target="_blank">ticket</a> where Baeta proposed the changes was overwhelmingly positive and the new color updates will land in 4.2. Core committer Matt Miklic aptly <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2015-02-05T00%3A58%3A50Z&precision=second" target="_blank">summarized</a> the overall consensus:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My subjective feeling is that the shift in colors is so slight, it doesn’t really change the feeling we intended to convey with the original MP6 colors. If anything, it makes the grays look more intentional, a color palette designed to work harmoniously rather than pairing a signature shade of blue with a lot of neutral grays.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Why It&#8217;s Important for Companies and Projects to Iterate on Branding</h3>\n<p>Like it or not, users tend to judge software by how it looks. Even the most minute color choices can affect public perception of an application. Most users are not likely to consciously perceive the changes in this round of WordPress admin iterations, but the improved harmony of the colors will make it easier on the eyes.</p>\n<p>Baeta believes that companies and open source projects need to be open to iterating on their branding every now and then to keep pace with where the web is going.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe a brand is something we should cherish very dearly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a project/company&#8217;s most recognizable asset, right?  I think iteration should happen in order to achieve refinement and keep a brand relevant.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Specially when a brand doesn&#8217;t begin with a strong set of assets and rules, it allows for the people involved to treat it as they think is best. Eventually atrocities like the fauxgo make everyone regret the absence of rules.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons that Baeta is involved in the initiative to document and refine the project&#8217;s brand through contributions to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/" target="_blank">WordPress.org&#8217;s Design Handbook</a>. Without clear branding guidelines, anyone can take the logo and colors and alter them in ways that muddle the project&#8217;s brand as a whole.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the web has evolved greatly since WordPress first started,&#8221; Baeta said. &#8220;WordPress is now a mature project that deserves to have its very recognizable brand refined and documented to make sure it is protected for years to come.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Apr 2015 19:06:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.4.4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"http://z9.io/?p=89499439";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://z9.io/2015/04/07/wp-super-cache-1-4-4/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2258:"<p>WP Super Cache is a full page caching plugin for WordPress.

Obenland&#8217;s latest contribution to WordPress is the <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design">redesigned theme directory</a>. Taylor is largely responsible for the <a title="http://scotty-t.com/2014/04/16/wordpress-3-9-audiovideo/" href="http://scotty-t.com/2014/04/16/wordpress-3-9-audiovideo/">audio and video improvements</a> in WordPress 3.9.</p>\n<p>Nacin defines a WordPress release lead as someone who sets the parameters for a release like schedule, deadlines, and helps to decide which feature plugins are merged. They also direct discussions in core development chats, write announcement posts, and shepherds contributions.</p>\n<p>Usually, release leads are not chosen until the beginning of the next development cycle. However, so many people volunteered to lead WordPress 4.2, it gave the team an opportunity to choose them in advance.</p>\n<p>Obenland says it&#8217;s too early to determine what he will focus on for WordPress 4.3, but there may be some incremental flow and user experience improvements.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m still in the process of gathering information and getting a feel for what’s cooking and what could be ready for 4.3. As of right now (three days into the process) there is no clear headline feature emerging but it looks like there will be a number of nice incremental flow and user experience improvements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Obenland what it means to him and the WordPress project for release leads to be chosen this far in advance.</p>\n<blockquote><p>First of all it means I actually get to do the above, plan ahead of time. So far, Release Lead appointments happened somewhat last minute so there wasn’t a lot of time to prepare. I now have the luxury of being able to compose a list of proposed features ahead of the kick-off meeting, rather than having to come up with that list during the meeting, which will hopefully lead to a more efficient discussion and evaluation of those features.</p>\n<p>Scott is able to groom feature plugins to get them ready for 4.4, which has been the goal for Release Leads for a while. Going forward, we’ll be in a position where not only Release Leads, but the community, get a chance to plan ahead more than one release at a time. This should have a positive impact on the quality of feature plugins and make for less hurried merges.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Choosing release leads in advance removes friction and enables a smoother transition from one lead to another. It also gives the core team momentum to transfer from one development cycle to the next.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how this impacts feature plugin development and whether or not the team will be able to maintain momentum into the WordPress 4.5 dev cycle.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 21:58:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.2 Will Natively Support Chinese, Korean, and Japanese Characters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41600";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://wptavern.com/emoji-enables-wordpress-to-natively-support-chinese-korean-and-japanese-characters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2661:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/emoji.png" rel="prettyphoto[41600]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33173" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/emoji.png?resize=620%2C420" alt="emoji" /></a>WordPress 4.2 will soon be released with <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-on-track-to-expand-core-support-for-emoji" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-on-track-to-expand-core-support-for-emoji">expanded core support for emoji</a>, a new feature that users either love or love to hate.

At that time many of their themes had issues that would preclude them from being hosted in the official directory.</p>\n<p>The team has been hard at work bringing their themes up to snuff and now have two that have passed the WordPress Theme Review Team&#8217;s guidelines. <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/gridsby/" target="_blank">Gridsby</a>, a theme for photographers, is ModernTheme&#8217;s latest release.</p>\n<p>The theme takes your photographs and arranges them in a mobile-friendly Masonry.js-powered grid on the homepage, followed by optional widget areas and a blog section. Site navigation is hidden behind a slide-out panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby.png" rel="prettyphoto[41558]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="gridsby" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41560" /></a></p>\n<p>Gridsby was created to be flexible and easy for users to personalize. The theme includes a impressive array of customization options available in the native customizer, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload a logo to replace the default site name and description in the header</li>\n<li>Upload your site favicon and Apple Icons</li>\n<li>Add social media links and customize icon color and hover color</li>\n<li>Hide gallery and/or blog section on the homepage</li>\n<li>Display your posts in ascending or descending order</li>\n<li>Customize View More button text and gallery button URL</li>\n<li>Show/hide homepage widgets, set number of columns and customize widgets background and button text</li>\n<li>Add footer contact info</li>\n<li>Customize typography with a selection of Google fonts</li>\n<li>Customize colors for text, links, blockquotes, accents, navigation, etc.</li>\n<li>Set blog excerpt length and Read More text</li>\n<li>Add a background image</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to its unusually long list of customization options, Gridsby authors created documentation, including tutorial videos for setting up its various features. The documentation is easily accessible from the WordPress admin under the Appearance menu:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby-documentation.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41558]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gridsby-documentation.jpg?resize=907%2C418" alt="gridsby-documentation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41608" /></a></p>\n<p>Gridsby works nicely as a theme for displaying photographs but could easily be tailored to work as a portfolio or similar visual showcase. I would not advise using this theme unless you are  committed to procuring large images for the galleries and blog post featured images.

The professional theme review service launched at the beginning of January and has been growing steadily, thanks in part to <a href="http://wptavern.com/themereview-co-inks-strategic-deal-with-studiopress-and-envato" target="_blank">strategic recommendations from Envato and StudioPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Uzelac and Tadlock are both senior reviewers at WordPress.org, and Tadlock is also a prolific plugin developer and co-author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222" target="_blank">Professional WordPress Plugin Development</a>. The two are currently testing the waters in branching out into plugin reviews and will only be accepting a limited number of customers until they&#8217;ve nailed down a definitive pricing structure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People have been asking about plugin reviews since day 1,&#8221; Tadlock told the Tavern. &#8220;It&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve both been thinking about. Therefore, we decided to do a soft launch of the service.  We need to get a few reviews under our belt to <em>standardize</em> our service, so to speak.&#8221;</p>\n<p>ThemeReview.co will be using <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards" target="_blank">WordPress Coding Standards</a> as the basic criteria for plugin reviews. However, plugin architecture is less rigorously regulated than theme code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously, there&#8217;s no standard set of guidelines like we have with themes,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could create those guidelines. Plugins are so vastly different that there&#8217;s no way to know what we&#8217;ll be reviewing from one plugin to the next.  However, some things we&#8217;ve done with theme reviews will carry over into plugins such as using standard WordPress APIs, validating/sanitizing data, and licensing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in the WordPress code quality review business, then plugin developers are a vast market you would be remiss to leave untapped. If you take WordPress.org as an example, themes make up roughly 10% of listings (~3,000) as compared to plugins (~37,000). Outside of WordPress.org&#8217;s small selection of extensions, there are thousands more products, both commercial and free.</p>\n<p>So far, the theme review aspect of the business has been moderately successful. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made more than Theme Hybrid, my first foray into a professional WordPress service, did in it&#8217;s first few months,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;However, we&#8217;re not quite at that point of where Emil and I could do this full time yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As plugins are the very close cousin of themes, their addition is a natural pivot for the theme review duo. Plugin products have also increasingly become a larger portion of the profits for theme development shops, such as WooThemes and iThemes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m actually more excited about plugin reviews because it&#8217;s a bit like venturing out into the Wild West,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>\n<p>While respected plugin developers such as Pippin Williamson have offered contract assistance in helping plugin authors review and improve their work, no business has tackled plugin code reviews as one of its primary services. <a href="http://themereview.co/" target="_blank">ThemeReview.co</a> will be the first to attempt to standardize this process. For the time being, the company will provide custom quotes for reviews, based on the amount and complexity of the code.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 17:04:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Matt: Meat Drunk";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44905";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/meat-drunk/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:131:"<p>Have you heard <em><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/meat-drunk-bbq-expert-much-good-thing/">of being meat drunk</a>?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 05 Apr 2015 21:26:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Alcohol or Marijuana?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44908";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/alcohol-or-marijuana/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:380:"<blockquote><p>It would be nice to imagine your children won’t abuse any substances, but also unrealistic.

Sometimes members are too lazy to upload a profile photo, no matter how many friendly prompts you try to offer.</p>\n<p>Missing profile images makes for ugly directory pages and less colorful BuddyPress widgets. It makes it seem like users aren&#8217;t invested enough in your site to bother with having an avatar.

Although he talks about the industry as a whole, MacGloinn says the need for specialized WordPress hosting is quickly disappearing.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class="s1">With the lingering perception that this stuff must be difficult, and the customer’s delight with all that WordPress can do these days, the specialist WordPress hosts get a lot more credit than they deserve.</span></p>\n<p><span class="s1">The problem is that modern technologies are rapidly rendering their role unnecessary. Anyone can now go to Linode or Digital Ocean and fire up their own VPS (Virtual Private Server) within half a minute, for a fraction of the approximately $30 cost of the most basic, one-WordPress-installation package from a specialist WordPress host. </span></p>\n<p><span class="s1">The VPS user can then use Docker or a similar technology to instantly install all they need for any number of secure, optimized installations of WordPress, all running with more memory, storage and bandwidth. The dirty secret of the specialist WordPress hosting industry: this is exactly what most of them are doing themselves.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>If specialized WordPress hosts rely on cloud infrastructure services like Amazon Web Services and charge a premium to customers, what stops Amazon from providing a great managed WordPress hosting experience, thereby eliminating the middleman? As MacGloinn points out, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have already made moves to provide the best out-of-the box experience.</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class="s1">Just last Friday, Google announced Google Cloud Launcher, enabling push-button deployment of over 120 top Open Source applications, including WordPress, to the Google Cloud Platform. Just two days before that, Microsoft launched the Azure App Service, which does essentially the same thing from a slightly different angle.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>VPS (Virtual Private Servers) and other technical jargon is scary to a lot of people, but if companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft can provide a great out-of-the box experience and charge a significantly lower price compared to specialized hosts, it&#8217;s possible the managed WordPress hosting space could disappear.</p>\n<p>The article has a <a title="http://www.wpmayor.com/the-end-of-the-web-hosting-industry/#comments" href="http://www.wpmayor.com/the-end-of-the-web-hosting-industry/#comments">few comments</a> from readers and offers a lot of food for thought, but I really want to hear from those who own and operate specialized WordPress hosting companies.

Their qualitative analysis, titled <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~mlw/pubs/icwsm2014-favouriting.pdf" target="_blank">More than Liking and Bookmarking? Towards Understanding Twitter Favouriting Behaviour</a>, dissects the various motivations for using the feature:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The survey responses from these users demonstrate that motives for favouriting tweets are extremely heterogeneous and not always consistent within and between users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although many other apps and websites have offered favoriting for years, this study on Twitter favoriting was one of the first to reveal just how complex and nuanced the feature can become in the hands of users.</p>\n<h3>Add Favorites to WordPress Posts</h3>\n<p>Favoriting is a subjective activity that is interpreted purely by individual motivation. The simple act of pushing a button results in a myriad of functional and communicative uses, making it one of the more interesting interactive features that you can add to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Favoriting capabilities are especially important when it comes to custom post types. Not every site needs this feature, but it is particularly helpful for those with large amounts of content stored in custom post types, such as books, recipes, movies, jobs, or real estate listings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/favorites/" target="_blank">Favorites</a> is a new plugin that was released last month on WordPress.org. It is easy for end users to set up but was also created with developers in mind. The plugin provides an API for adding a favorite button to any post type.</p>\n<p>The Favorites settings panel allows you to select the post types where you want favoriting functionality to apply. You can also customize the button text in order to make it suitable for bookmarking, liking, favoriting, or any other similar use.</p>\n<p>Favorites will automatically add a favorite button at the top or bottom of your posts. The button intuitively takes on the styles of your active theme, as you can see in this example with the <a href="http://wptavern.com/hew-a-free-wordpress-blogging-theme-inspired-by-ryu">Hew</a> theme:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/favorite-button-on-post.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[40043]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/favorite-button-on-post.jpg?resize=837%2C504" alt="favorite-button-on-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41485" /></a></p>\n<p>Use of the plugin requires WordPress version 3.8+ and PHP version 5.3.2+. <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kylephillips" target="_blank">Kyle Phillips</a>, author of Favorites, summarized the features to include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use with Any Post Type</strong> &#8211; Enable or disable favorite functionality per post type while automatically adding a favorite button before and/or after the content. Alternatively, you can use the included functions to display the button anywhere in your template.</li>\n<li><strong>Available for All Users</strong> – Don&#8217;t want to hide functionality behind a login? Favorites includes an option to save anonymous users&#8217; favorites by either Session or Cookie. Logged-In users&#8217; favorites are also saved as user meta.</li>\n<li><strong>Designed for Developers</strong> &#8211; Favorites works great out of the box for beginners, but a full set of template functions unlocks just about any sort of custom functionality developers may need. Favorites outputs the minimum amount of markup needed, putting the style and control in your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Phillip set up the <a href="https://favoriteposts.com/" target="_blank">favoriteposts.com</a> site to house documentation for the plugin, including options, settings, available shortcodes, and a function reference for outputting the button, favorite counts, and a list of user favorites.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-3.png" rel="prettyphoto[40043]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/screenshot-3.png?resize=900%2C726" alt="screenshot-3" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41495" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering if Favorites is compatible with your caching solution, the short answer is &#8216;yes,&#8217; according to the plugin&#8217;s FAQ page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes, although the buttons may display the incorrect state momentarily. Button states are updated via an AJAX call after page load in order to accommodate cached pages. This may be noticeable on slower servers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After having tried many different post bookmarking plugins for WordPress, I found Favorites to be the easiest one to use with the most intuitive button display.

More than 700 participants gathered in London to share knowledge and experiences surrounding PHP and related web technologies.</p>\n<p>WordPress community members <a href="https://twitter.com/miss_jwo" target="_blank">Jenny Wong</a> and <a href="http://aaron.jorb.in/" target="_blank">Aaron Jorbin</a> both spoke at the conference and the videos have just been released today. During Wong&#8217;s keynote presentation, titled &#8220;Integrating Communities,&#8221; she told the story of how she learned PHP by attending local user groups, asking questions, and embracing the community. Her session encouraged those in attendance to build bridges between technology communities.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>Wong came to WordPress from the PHP community and her presentation addressed the friction that is often present between the two. I spoke with her about the inspiration behind her topic and the deeper issues underlying the general lack of understanding between the two communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lots of people have used WordPress when it was young &#8211; maybe before all the beautiful UI came in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am not one of those people, but I&#8217;ve heard the stories of how bad the UX was.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some people learned to live with it and became part of the WP community; some people hated it and left. The people who left have a particular ideal of WordPress from their very old experience and unless we as a community reach out to them, their perceptions will not change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She believes that WordPress contributors should strive to attend and speak at non-WordCamp conferences to learn from and experience other communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Inside the WP community I often hear, &#8216;How do you become better at PHP?&#8217; <span class="pullquote alignleft">We need to show them that the WP community is welcomed by the PHP community and that it is not a scary place</span>,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The situation is gradually improving across many events, as ZendCon <a href="https://twitter.com/zendcon/status/583638815237087232" target="_blank">announced</a> today that it will be including a WordPress track. WordPress community members made an effort to attend <a href="http://world.phparch.com/" target="_blank">PHP World 2014</a>, PHP developer <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/" target="_blank">Lorna Jane Mitchell</a> spoke at WordCamp London, and PHP South West (a user group in the UK) recently had a joint night with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bristol-WordPress-People/" target="_blank">Bristol WordPress People</a> user group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing more and more of this cross pollination, at least between the WP and PHP community, slowly,&#8221; Wong said.</p>\n<h3>Venturing Outside the WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>Speaking at WordCamps is an excellent way to give back and connect with others in the community, but the value of venturing outside of the WordPress bubble is often overlooked. Aaron Jorbin attended the PHP UK conference knowing only one person.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there is a personal benefit in putting ourselves in situations we aren&#8217;t automatically comfortable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to knowing a lot of people at events. Knowing only one person before hand helps me do a better job of empathizing with people that feel like outsiders at WordPress events. <span class="pullquote alignleft">If we want to do a better job of creating diversity, it&#8217;s good to feel the problems people feel when they don&#8217;t feel like they belong.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jorbin spoke on Modernizing the WordPress Toolbox. His presentation goes far beyond the topic of modernizing WordPress&#8217; build tools to include his passion for removing barriers to contributing to the project. Jorbin also delved deeper into the reasons behind the project&#8217;s selection of certain tools.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;We as a community need to do a better job of both getting out there and bringing people in,&#8221; Jorbin said.  &#8220;This is something that we have improved over the last few years (Nacin keynoting PHP Tech, Joe Dolson and Joseph O&#8217;Connor at CSUN, Mel Choyce, Nacin and myself at OS Bridge, etc.), but we have a long way to go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Currently, going outside of the WordPress space usually means that you will encounter some negative opinions about WordPress. Jorbin said that these are largely born out of a lack of knowledge of WordPress and why contributors make the decisions that they make.</p>\n<p>&#8220;PHP developers hear things like PHP 5.2 as a minimum and write us off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When they hear that 1) We run just fine on PHP 5.6, and 2) are already running our automated tests on php7, and 3) that we do it based on our user focused philosophies, they understand it and actually gain a lot of respect for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond combating negative opinions of the software, Jorbin believes that the WordPress community can find a wealth of knowledge outside of WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another benefit is hearing how other projects are solving problems helps WordPress solve problems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hearing about <a href="http://drupalladder.org/" target="_blank">The Drupal Ladder</a> influences how I think about on-boarding new contributors. Hearing about how Etsy started using HHVM helps me get ideas for rolling out HHVM on WordPress sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you make the effort to venture outside of your usual networks, you will undoubtedly encounter situations wherein your skills of diplomacy and bridge-building will be sharpened, as both Wong and Jorbin found at the PHP UK conference. However, the value gained in connecting with other communities far outweighs the challenges. The WordPress community has a great deal to share with the world, but it is also enriched by other technologies.</p>\n<p>If you already speak at multiple WordCamps per year, here&#8217;s a new challenge for 2015: Speak at a conference outside the WordPress bubble where you may not know many people. Who knows who you&#8217;ll meet or what you might learn?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 23:37:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Warped Silicon Valley";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44898";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2015/04/warped-silicon-valley/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:441:"<p>As a counterpoint to yesterday&#8217;s link to the Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, here&#8217;s a Washington Post story, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-one-mans-utopian-vision-for-the-internet-conquered-and-then-badly-warped-silicon-valley/2015/03/20/7dbe39f8-cdab-11e4-a2a7-9517a3a70506_story.html">Meet the man whose utopian vision for the Internet conquered, and then warped, Silicon Valley</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 20:41:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: Display Sheet Music in WordPress With the ABC Notation Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41412";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wptavern.com/display-sheet-music-in-wordpress-with-the-abc-notation-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1777:"<p>If you&#8217;re a musician or a music teacher and want to show sheet music in WordPress, you might be interested in a new plugin <a title="http://wordpress.paulrosen.net/plugins/abc-notation/" href="http://wordpress.paulrosen.net/plugins/abc-notation/">developed by Paul Rosen</a> called <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/abc-notation/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/abc-notation/">ABC Notation</a>.

The new theme, designed by <a href="http://soakingupthelight.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ola Laczek</a>, was inspired by <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes/ryu" target="_blank">Ryu</a>, a classic among personal blogging themes.

I wanted to create a personal-blogging theme which shows an author’s identity – via Gravatar logo and social media links in the header – while staying focused on their content.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The theme includes one optional custom menu in the top bar, which is displayed to the left of the social links menu. Hew keeps the focus on content by hiding all four of its widget areas within a slide-out top panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-top-widgets.png" rel="prettyphoto[41372]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-top-widgets.png?resize=640%2C284" alt="hew-top-widgets" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41388" /></a></p>\n<p>As is the case with virtually every other recent theme release from WordPress.com, Hew includes support for post formats. The theme prominently features post format icons at the top of every post. Each format has its own subtle differences in style.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-quote-post-formats.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[41372]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hew-quote-post-formats.jpg?resize=986%2C421" alt="hew-quote-post-formats" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41392" /></a></p>\n<p>Hew&#8217;s customizer options include the ability to change the header image from your Gravatar to something else, as well as the ability to customize the background and header text color. If you&#8217;re hoping to be able to change the yellow highlight color used throughout the theme, I didn&#8217;t see an easy option to do this.

Aleksić is a growth researcher and analyst at <a href="https://managewp.com/" target="_blank">ManageWP</a> by day but also has a passion for design.</p>\n<p>Despite having worked with WordPress for a few years, his first contact with the community was at <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-beyond-boundaries-a-recap-of-wordcamp-europe-2014" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2014</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was blown away by the positive attitude of the people there (especially Remkus de Vries and Chris Lema &#8211; those two are a force of nature) and decided I wanted to be a part of it,&#8221; Aleksić said. When he found out about WordCamp Belgrade getting approved, he decided to offer his help to Milan Ivanović and the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of creating our own Wapuu several times in the past, but it wasn&#8217;t until I read your article on <a href="http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015" target="_blank">Scott Evans&#8217; punk Wapuu</a> that I finally decided to do something about it,&#8221; Aleksić said. &#8220;I sat down with my colleague <a href="https://www.behance.net/milica_spasojevic" target="_blank">Milica</a>  and created Wapuujlo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wapuujlo&#8217;s attire represents a melding of Serbian tradition with the WordPress mission of democratizing publishing. Aleksić explained his inspiration for the mascot&#8217;s design:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The hat šajkača, a traditional Serbian hat worn by the common folk back in the day, was a logical choice because it represents the people using WordPress to have their voices heard. The plum was Milica&#8217;s idea &#8211; it&#8217;s our national symbol, representing prosperity and unity. These two ideas gave Wapuujlo a traditional vibe, which is a nice contrast to the futuristic/anime variants of the Japanese Wapuu. Even the name Wapuujlo is a nod to traditional Serbian names.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Aleksić found the wapuu SVG file to be easy to alter and the team was able to perform the changes in under five minutes. &#8220;I expect that Belgrade, London, and Philly wapuus will prompt other WordPress communities to come up with their own versions of the mascot,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just don&#8217;t go overboard with the alterations: keep it clean, simple and recognizable,&#8221; Aleksić advised those who want to design a wapuu mascot for an event.</p>\n<p>The trend of creating custom mascots for WordCamps seems to be rapidly catching on outside of Japan. The first edition of WordCamp Belgrade is a historic event for <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community" target="_blank">Serbia&#8217;s WordPress community</a> and the organizers wanted to offer a commemorative wapuu sticker as part of the branding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to continue the tradition and inspire other WordCamps out there to include Wapuu as a must,&#8221; Ivanović said. &#8220;I just love that cute little fellow!&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Apr 2015 00:14:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: How to Use LICEcap to Record and Turn Screen Captures into Animated GIFs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=41316";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-use-licecap-to-record-and-turn-screen-captures-into-animated-gifs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3800:"<p>When I wrote about <a title="http://wptavern.com/enhanced-plugin-installs-axed-from-wordpress-4-2" href="http://wptavern.com/enhanced-plugin-installs-axed-from-wordpress-4-2">enhanced plugin installs being removed</a> from WordPress 4.2 last week, a few readers asked how I created the animated image that shows how shiny updates work. I used <a title="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/" href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a> by Çockos Incorporated, which is free, GPL licensed software available for Windows and OSX.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LicecapFrame.png" rel="prettyphoto[41316]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41321" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LicecapFrame.png?resize=648%2C508" alt="LICEcap Frame" /></a>LICEcap Frame\n<p>LICEcap has an adjustable frame that you place over the content you want to record. You can adjust the frame manually by dragging the edges with your mouse cursor, or you can type in an exact size. You can also adjust the max frames per second, but keep in mind that the higher the number, the larger the file size will be.</p>\n<p>When you hit the record button, you&#8217;ll be prompted to name the file and select where it will be saved. There&#8217;s also configuration settings that allow you to manipulate the recording.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingSettings.png" rel="prettyphoto[41316]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41322" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingSettings.png?resize=660%2C222" alt="Recording Settings" /></a>Recording Settings\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what most of the options do and LICEcap doesn&#8217;t have any documentation outside of <a title="http://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44" href="http://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=44">this discussion forum</a>. I recommend checking the box to use Control + Alt + P to pause the recording. This way, you won&#8217;t see the mouse cursor move off the screen to click the pause button. LICEcap doesn&#8217;t have an editor to manage frames so if you make a mistake, you&#8217;ll have to start over. Since animated GIFs should be as short and small as possible, the lack of a frame editor isn&#8217;t a big deal.</p>\n<p>Once everything is configured, click the save button and a three second countdown begins. When the countdown reaches 0, LICEcap begins recording movement within the frame. On the bottom left of the recording window, you&#8217;ll see the size of the frame, timestamp, and the amount of FPS.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingWindow.png" rel="prettyphoto[41316]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41323" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LICEcapRecordingWindow.png?resize=693%2C557" alt="Recording Status " /></a>Recording Status\n<p>Once you&#8217;re satisfied with the recording, upload the GIF file to the WordPress media library. When you insert it into a post, make sure to use the full size image since animated GIFs don&#8217;t scale as well as JPG files.</p>\n<h2>A Few Tips When Creating Animated GIFs</h2>\n<p>Keep the recording as short and small as possible. Resize the recording window so it&#8217;s only as big as necessary. Animation such as scrolling and page browsing should be kept to a minimum. Last but not least, play with the recording options as there might be a combination that decreases the file size of recordings.</p>\n<p>Animated GIFs are great for a few laughs, but they&#8217;re also an excellent way to show how something works.

The session should make it onto WordPress.tv sometime soon, but in the meantime he created a screencast for those who couldn&#8217;t attend.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://jacklenox.com/2015/03/30/building-themes-with-the-wp-rest-api-wordcamp-london-march-2015/" target="_blank">video</a> is actually an extended edition of his talk and runs for a full 50 minutes. Lenox starts by answering the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal about the REST API?&#8221; He also demos the speed of getting content from the API using a few live examples.</p>\n<p>His presentation offers theme developers a few reasons for why they may want to look into building themes that use the WP REST API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides a way to retrieve pure data (usually in JSON or XML format) over HTTP</li>\n<li>No loops necessary</li>\n<li>Good for mobile apps and environments where you don&#8217;t want a full webpage to render but want content from a blog or site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lenox gives a basic overview of what can you do with the WP REST API, even without knowing any PHP. The benefits he cites include a more engaging user experience, potentially reduced server load, improved speed, and better control over failed connections. During the presentation he shows examples of how to incorporate single page application elements into WordPress themes where interactions are handled by JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The Picard theme that he demos is aptly named as a play on the next generation of themes. It&#8217;s a prototype WordPress theme built with React and the upcoming WP-API. If you want to play with it, you can clone the repository on <a href="https://github.com/jacklenox/picard-present" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Automattic is aiming to open source the Picard theme around the beginning of May.</p>\n<p>Interest surrounding the presentation demonstrates how excited the WordPress community is to start incorporating the new API into their projects. Many who attended the session at WordCamp London were inspired to start looking at themes in a new way.</p>\n<p>The resulting experience of pre-loading all the content allows users to zip around without any delay. It&#8217;s a dramatic improvement and an amazing example of how a theme can have much more control over the speed and resources needed to present content on the frontend.

The move is in response to requests from its community and recognizing it has become an important repository of U.S. Government works and historical content.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve been proud to support Creative Commons licenses since 2004, and we’ve become an important repository of U.S. Government works and historic images from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums around the world (check out <a href="https://www.flickr.com/commons">The Flickr Commons</a> for examples).</p>\n<p>But we’ve heard from our community that we’re missing two important designations: Public Domain and Creative Commons 0 (CC0). Many members of our community want to be able to upload images that are no longer protected by copyright and correctly tag them as being in the Public Domain, or they want to release their copyright entirely under CC0.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a title="http://www.spacex.com/" href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> is the first <a title="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos">Flickr account</a> to change its image designation to CC0.

Flickr only provides four different search filters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any License</li>\n<li>Creative Commons Only</li>\n<li>  Commercial use allowed</li>\n<li>  Modifications allowed</li>\n</ul>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LackofSearch.png" rel="prettyphoto[41269]"><img class="size-full wp-image-41274" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LackofSearch.png?resize=1025%2C423" alt="Lack of Search Filters" /></a>Lack of Search Filters\n<p>Since CC0 is mixed in the other Creative Commons license types, it&#8217;s difficult to search only for images with the CC0 and Public Domain designations. Until Flickr adds specific license filters to its search box, users will likely spend more time searching for images instead of using them.</p>\n<p>Despite not being able to easily find them, enabling users to waive all copyright protection on photographs should increase the amount of freely available images to use. This is a huge win and in the future, could make Flickr the largest source of Public Domain images on the web.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 01 Apr 2015 01:24:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"Post Status: How StoryCorps uses WordPress to enable storytelling everywhere";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=12142";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"https://poststatus.com/how-storycorps-uses-wordpress-to-enable-storytelling-everywhere/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10814:"<p><a href="http://storycorps.org/">StoryCorps</a> is an organization that aims &#8220;to provide people of all backgrounds and beliefs with the opportunity to record, share and preserve the stories of our lives.&#8221; Featured stories are broadcast nationally on NPR.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps has published more than 50,000 interviews with almost 100,000 participants since they launched in 2003.

The stories tend to be very powerful. I was nearly brought to tears by one where <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/i-just-hugged-the-man-who-murdered-my-son/">a lady hugs her son&#8217;s murderer</a>. Another moving story (from my hometown no less), features a father that <a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/william-watford-iii-and-deidra-robinson/">comes to terms with his daughter&#8217;s homosexuality</a>. Or there&#8217;s one where President Obama<a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/noah-mcqueen-and-barack-obama-150225/"> interviews a boy who overcame adversity to join My Brother&#8217;s Keeper</a>.</p>\n<h3>Record stories anywhere</h3>\n<p>The latest initiative for creating ways for people to share their story is via <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a>, a website and companion apps that make it easy for anyone with a smartphone to record an interview and publish it.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps.me is built on WordPress, and utilizes the <a title="The WordPress REST API" href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/">WordPress REST API</a> to enable access to a customized content architecture. The StoryCorps app utilizes the API to consume data and publish stories from the app back to the website.</p>\n<p>I interviewed Dean Haddock, Director of Digital &amp; Technical Innovation at StoryCorps, about how the idea for the app came about, how they use and think of WordPress, and other insights from their short three month development period.</p>\n<p>Listen to the interview:</p>\n<a href="https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3">https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3</a>\n<p><a href="https://audio.simplecast.fm/9832.mp3">Direct Download</a></p>\n<h3>A national day of listening</h3>\n<p>Dean says he thinks the StoryCorps app really dates back to a program they ran three years ago called A National Day of Listening, where instead of shopping on Black Friday, they hosted an event where people could tell stories.</p>\n<p>Dean&#8217;s team expanding on the idea, and the event turned <a href="http://diy.storycorps.org/">into a micro-site</a> using SoundCloud&#8217;s API that made that process easier. That project eventually expanded into the idea that would become StoryCorps.me.</p>\n<h3>Funding for the app</h3>\n<p>The StoryCorps app was funded thanks to StoryCorps founder Dave Isay winning this year’s TED Prize, with a substantial amount of research and development conducted under the 2014 Knight Foundation Prototype Award. He gave a TED Talk in Vancouver just a few weeks ago, where he shared how <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en">everyone has a story to tell</a>.</p>\n<div id="attachment_12145" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en"><img class="wp-image-12145 size-large" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/dave-isay-752x391.png" alt="Dave Isay at TED" width="752" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dave Isay at TED</p></div>\n<blockquote><p>The TED Prize is awarded to an individual with a creative, bold vision to spark global change. By leveraging the TED community’s resources and investing $1 million into a powerful idea, each year the TED Prize supports one wish to inspire the world.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize">- TED Prize website</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>His wish after winning the TED Prize was to &#8220;to grow this digital archive of the collective wisdom of humanity.&#8221; During the TED Talk, he noted that StoryCorps is &#8220;the single largest collection of human voices ever collected.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new app makes this mission even more plausible, by having almost no barrier for interview creation. The $1 million TED Prize made it possible.</p>\n<h3>Development of the StoryCorps app</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12146" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/storycorps-app-752x444.jpg" alt="storycorps-app" width="752" height="444" /></p>\n<p>With &#8220;one tap&#8221;, interviews can be created and uploaded to the StoryCorps.me website and the Library of Congress archive.</p>\n<p>Dave shared some of his vision for the app during the TED Talk:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id="t-1069355" class="talk-transcript__fragment">Imagine, for example, a national homework assignment</span> <span id="t-1073093" class="talk-transcript__fragment">where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country</span> <span id="t-1077087" class="talk-transcript__fragment">records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,</span> <span id="t-1079989" class="talk-transcript__fragment">so that in one single weekend</span> <span id="t-1082892" class="talk-transcript__fragment">an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Development of the app was managed on three levels.</p>\n<p>The StoryCorps team did project management, communication, and handled RFPs for app and website development. They also ensured that everything fit the StoryCorps model, and ensured that the new website and app talked to existing StoryCorps software and APIs properly.</p>\n<p><a href="http://10up.com">10up</a> built the website infrastructure, manages scalability issues, and managed the integration of the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p><a href="http://maya.com/news/maya-creates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanityreates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanity">MAYA design</a> designed and built the app for the end-user, utilizing PhoneGap so that the app could be launched simultaneously to both iOS and Android platforms.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;We knew we going to use WordPress before we started looking for partners to help us build this thing.&#8221;</span> As a &#8220;small to midsize non-profit,&#8221; StoryCorps has few resources. StoryCorps.org has been on WordPress, and they wanted to use WordPress for StoryCorps.me as well.</p>\n<p>The development phase was quite short: from funding to launch took only three months. They launched at TED after receiving the funding last October.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For public facing web technology, WordPress is so flexible and so malleable and amenable to whatever we need to do with it, that it really wasn&#8217;t much of a question whether this was the right platform.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What their real question was, Dean shares, was how WordPress could scale if and when they hit a million users, and that&#8217;s why they brought in 10up.</p>\n<h3>What they learned</h3>\n<p>They are really pleased with how the project has gone so far. However, not everything was a success. They had to pivot and make adjustments as they went along and learned new things and requirements.</p>\n<p>Dean noted, <span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;You have to be willing to completely submit to the process.&#8221;</span> He says it wouldn&#8217;t have succeeded if 10up and Maya weren&#8217;t committed as StoryCorps to the success of the project.</p>\n<p>They also learned what Dean calls &#8220;more tangible&#8221; things, like the usage of PhoneGap. Without using a tool like PhoneGap, they wouldn&#8217;t have been able to &#8220;get to market as soon as possible.&#8221; However, he admits the app could be slightly better if it were built in a native platform to either iOS or Android.</p>\n<h3>Powerful stories</h3>\n<p>I really enjoyed digging into StoryCorps mission and the new <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a> project. I&#8217;m addicted to their stories, and some of the stories that have been uploaded &#8212; such as <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/krisalyn-cut-her-hair/">those</a> <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/grandmas-favorite-memories/">in</a> the audio intro &#8212; are really endearing.</p>\n<p>While there may be an element of noise to the StoryCorps.me archive, it&#8217;s already evident that many gems will emerge, and who knows what ideas people will come up with for creative ways to perform interviews and record stories.</p>\n<p>The apps are available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bottlerocketapps.storycorps">Google Play</a> and in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/storycorps/id359071069?mt=8">App Store</a>. It&#8217;ll be improving over the next weeks and and months. If you&#8217;re excited about technology at StoryCorps, you can reach Dean at <a href="mailto:dhaddock@storycorps.org">dhaddock@storycorps.org</a> or you can also report issues or ask questions about the app at <a href="mailto:contactus@storycorps.me">contactus@storycorps.me</a>.</p>\n<p>StoryCorps is a great testament to WordPress and its ability to be an infrastructure to an app at scale, while also enabling efficient development cycles. This is probably my favorite utilization of the new REST API yet.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 23:21:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:22:52 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"210989";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:15:14 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20140929153847";}', 'no');

Comienza de a poco para que tus músculos y huesos se fortalezcan y adquieran flexibilidad.\r\n\r\n2. Si el motivo por el cual dejaste el ejercicio fue una enfermedad o lesión consulta antes a tu médico y pregúntale acerca de las contraindicaciones de tu rutina.\r\n\r\n3.

Arma un horario con tu rutina, y define que ejercitaras cada día, si estas partiendo te recomiendo descansar día por medio cada día ejercitado\r\n\r\n5. Escucha a tu cuerpo y  acepta tus propias limitaciones, recuerda que esto no es una competencia con el resto y muy probable que si el de al lado levanta mas peso o corre mas minutos es porque lleve mas tiempo entrenando, anda paso a paso y se paciente.\r\n\r\n6.

El sueño reparador - el de noche no la siesta- el sueño de calidad es el que nos permite la limpieza celular adecuada. Es durante el sueño REM cuando el cuerpo quema mas calorías. Por esto no entrar en esta etapa nos priva de la quema de calorías y ganancia de peso debido a las hormonas leptina (hormona que le dice al cuerpo cuando dejar de comer) y grelina (hormona sensación de hambre ) elevándose y produciendo en nuestro organismo aumento de peso y grasa.

Comienza de a poco para que tus músculo y huesos se fortalezcan y adquieran flexibilidad.\r\n2. Si el motivo por el cual dejaste el ejercicio fue una enfermedad o lesión consulta antes a tu medico y pregúntale acerca de las contraindicaciones de tu rutina.\r\n3. Ponte objetivos, esto es muy importante para no perder el foco de tu entrenamiento, por ejemplo el mío fue adquirir fuerza en todo el tren superior y poder realizar algunas asanas de yoga que antes me eran imposibles debido a mis brazitos de lana y mi abdomen no fortalecido.\r\n4. Arma un horario con tu rutina, y define que ejercitaras cada día, si estas partiendo te recomiendo descansar día por medio cada día ejercitado\r\n5. Escucha a tu cuerpo y  acepta tus propias limitaciones, recuerda que esto no es una competencia con el resto y muy probable que si el de al lado levanta mas peso o corre mas minutos es porque lleve mas tiempo entrenando, anda paso a paso y se paciente.\r\n6. Elonga tus músculos el iniciar y terminar una sesión, hay entrenadores que no lo recomiendan, la verdad que a mi me funciona fantástico y mi cuerpo lo pide.\r\n\r\nAhora no hay excusas para comenzar ¡\r\n\r\n[gallery link="none" columns="2" ids="128,129"]', 'RETOMA TU RUTINA DE EJERCICIOS', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '99-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-07-12 00:09:15', '2014-07-12 00:09:15', '', 99, 'http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/99-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Comienza de a poco para que tus músculo y huesos se fortalezcan y adquieran flexibilidad. 2. Si el motivo por el cual dejaste el ejercicio fue una enfermedad o lesión consulta antes a tu medico y pregúntale acerca de las contraindicaciones de tu rutina. 3. Ponte objetivos, esto es muy importante para no perder el foco de tu entrenamiento, por ejemplo el mío fue adquirir fuerza en todo el tren superior y poder realizar algunas asanas de yoga que antes me eran imposibles debido a mis brazitos de lana y mi abdomen no fortalecido. 4. Arma un horario con tu rutina, y define que ejercitaras cada día, si estas partiendo te recomiendo descansar día por medio cada día ejercitado 5. Escucha a tu cuerpo y  acepta tus propias limitaciones, recuerda que esto no es una competencia con el resto y muy probable que si el de al lado levanta mas peso o corre mas minutos es porque lleve mas tiempo entrenando, anda paso a paso y se paciente. 6.

Comienza de a poco para que tus músculo y huesos se fortalezcan y adquieran flexibilidad. 2. Si el motivo por el cual dejaste el ejercicio fue una enfermedad o lesión consulta antes a tu medico y pregúntale acerca de las contraindicaciones de tu rutina. 3. Ponte objetivos, esto es muy importante para no perder el foco de tu entrenamiento, por ejemplo el mío fue adquirir fuerza en todo el tren superior y poder realizar algunas asanas de yoga que antes me eran imposibles debido a mis brazitos de lana y mi abdomen no fortalecido. 4. Arma un horario con tu rutina, y define que ejercitaras cada día, si estas partiendo te recomiendo descansar día por medio cada día ejercitado 5. Escucha a tu cuerpo y  acepta tus propias limitaciones, recuerda que esto no es una competencia con el resto y muy probable que si el de al lado levanta mas peso o corre mas minutos es porque lleve mas tiempo entrenando, anda paso a paso y se paciente. 6. Elonga tus músculos el iniciar y terminar una sesión, hay entrenadores que no lo recomiendan, la verdad que a mi me funciona fantástico y mi cuerpo lo pide.

La primera vez que hice no aguante nisiquiera la media hora, ahora hasta tengo mi propio TRX el que llevo conmigo a todos mis viajes.\r\n\r\nPor otro lado como mi intención era bajar mi porcentaje de grasa (que no era menor), me vi en la obligación de trotar (me quería mollir!), partí caminando a un ritmo medio debido a mi deplorable condición física, ahora ya corro hasta 60 min seguidos!.\r\n\r\nY el Yoga, mi gran amor. Mi primer acercamiento fue dos años antes y no logré ninguna conexión, no se que cambio en mi, pero esta vez la unión fue inmediata, al poco tiempo de estar yendo al Yoga del Gym, empecé a averiguar más de el, veía videos, me compré libros, leía mucho en internet y me di cuenta que necesitaba que mi práctica fuera guiada por un profesional completo en el área, ahí decidí a ingresar a una escuela de Yoga Iyengar, rico pero muy relajado para mi personalidad, estuve ahí hasta mi gran lesión (más adelante hablaré de ese episodio de mi vida) y ahora estoy en una nueva escuela, especializada en el Yoga Ashtanga mi pasión.\r\n\r\nLa verdad no me imagino mi vida sin deporte o sin el Yoga.

Como es feriado mi Gym y el Yoga están cerrados, así que mi rutina se traslada al aire libre. Nunca hay excusas!\r\n\r\nAyer por suerte el día nos acompaño y pudimos ir a realizar nuestro entrenamiento de Speedwork al cerro San Cristobal, un lugar ideal dentro de la ciudad para realizar ejercicios con una vista preciosa y todos en la misma onda.\r\n\r\nTenemos un grupo del Gym que cuando los días están bonitos y no hay tanta humedad nos juntamos a realizar Speedwork. Es un entrenamiento guiado por un profesor en base a estaciones, siempre son como 10 y en cada una trabajas diferentes músculos, el tiempo en cada una dura aproximadamente un minuto y luego rotas a la siguiente, el circuito total es de alrededor de 50 minutos, es un entrenamiento súper completo y que te deja con full energía para todo el día. Hay hartos grupos que desarrollan esto en diferentes parques de Santiago, Sólo acércate a uno y pregunta si estás interesado.\r\n\r\nValor clase Speedwork: $3.000 pesos.\r\n\r\nContacto instagram armando_coach\r\n\r\n<span style="font-size: 13px;">RECOMENDACIONES:</span>\r\n\r\n-Llega temprano ya que los estacionamientos a las 10:00 ya están llenos\r\n\r\n-Evita ir solo, y si lo haces no te metas en senderos no autorizados.\r\n\r\n-Anda liviano, un pequeño banano o mochila.\r\n\r\n-Nunca corras con botellas de agua en las manos, las necesitarás libres para apoyarte si te caes.\r\n\r\n-Calienta, elonga y ENJOY!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/salto-cuerda.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-278 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/salto-cuerda.jpg" alt="salto cuerda" width="1024" height="703" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'UN FERIADO ENTRETENIDO', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '275-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-09-03 23:07:05', '2014-09-03 23:07:05', '', 275, 'http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/275-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

El primero es que las imágenes utilizadas para representar el “thigh gap” son de mujeres extremadamente delgadas, casi en los huesos, que no promueven un estilo de vida saludable. El segundo es que l<span style="color: #545454;">a genética y la estructura del cuerpo juegan el papel más importante en lo que respecta a conseguir ese espacio entre los muslos.

Al final, ir al gimnasio acaba resumiéndose en elíptica, zumba o spinning para algunas, perdiéndose de lo realmente entretenido del workout.\r\n\r\n¿Es ese un entrenamiento apropiado? No, es un entrenamiento incompleto, por lo menos para mi. El error es que no le dan importancia a su musculatura y son precisamente los músculos los encargados de proteger los huesos y de aguantar bien el peso del cuerpo.\r\n\r\nEl ejercicio cardiovascular, que es el que hemos mencionado antes, trotadora y bicicleta, si se ejerce de manera prolongada y sin una correcta alimentación puede ir destruyendo la<strong> </strong>masa muscular. ¿Qué se puede hacer para contrarrestarlo? Levantar pesas. Es decir, ejercicios anaeróbicos. Los beneficios de trabajar con peso son muchos, algunos de ellos son.\r\n\r\n-Aumentas el metabolismo: <span style="color: #555555;">el músculo es el encargado de quemar calorías,tanto en reposo como durante la actividad física. Es decir, es una máquina quemar calorías. Si se pierde el músculo, el cuerpo dejará de consumir las mismas calorías y se acabarán acumulando en forma de grasa, provocando aumento de peso.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #555555;">-Tonificas tu cuerpo: el hecho de fortalecer la musculatura ayuda a conseguir una figura mucho más esbelta y definida. Solo con dieta o con ejercicio aeróbico no se consigue una figura igual de moldeada.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #555555;">-Proteges tus articulaciones: el músculo sustenta el sistema esquelético, evitando la transferencia de carga a nuestras articulaciones.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #555555;">-Ayuda a un mejor envejecimiento: sí, los estragos de la edad serán menos notorios en una persona que hace ejercicios de pesas, ya que el principal problema de las personas mayores es su pérdida progresiva de musculatura.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #555555;">-Mejora el funcionamiento interno de los órganos: entrenar correctamente los músculos hace que todos los órganos internos permanezcan en su posición y facilita los procesos de digestión, tránsito intestinal o incluso la respiración.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="color: #555555;">-Mejora tu día a día: hace que uno se sienta más fuerte y con más resistencia para llevar a cabo las tareas diarias.</span>\r\n\r\ny recuerda si quieres ganar músculo, debes hacer menos repeticiones y más peso.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sexy_gym_wear_super_strong_girl_by_fatenano-d6vqt7j.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-357 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sexy_gym_wear_super_strong_girl_by_fatenano-d6vqt7j.jpg" alt="sexy_gym_wear_super_strong_girl_by_fatenano-d6vqt7j" width="1023" height="781" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'ROMPE EL HIELO CON LAS PESAS', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '353-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-09-18 02:24:23', '2014-09-18 02:24:23', '', 353, 'http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/353-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Es una extraña y poco saludable tendencia si se es llevada al extremo, buscar ser tan delgada como para que la parte interior de los muslos no se toquen cuando tienes las rodillas juntas.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #666666;">Esta idea tiene dos problemas fundamentales. El primero es que las imágenes utilizadas para representar el “thigh gap” son de mujeres extremadamente delgadas, casi en los huesos, que no promueven un estilo de vida saludable. El segundo es que l<span style="color: #545454;">a genética y la estructura del cuerpo juegan el papel más importante en lo que respecta a conseguir ese espacio entre los muslos. En pocas palabras, la mayoría de mujeres tienen las caderas demasiado juntas para que pueda haber un espacio entre sus muslos, aun con muy poca grasa en sus piernas. Sin embargo, si tienes caderas más anchas, es posible conseguir ese espacio y al mismo tiempo mantener un peso promedio saludable</span>.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #666666;">La obsesión con el “Thigh Gap” puede representar problemas de salud serios para muchas mujeres.

Mi primer acercamiento fue dos años antes y no logré ninguna conexión, no se que cambio en mi, pero esta vez la unión fue inmediata, al poco tiempo de estar yendo al Yoga del Gym, empecé a averiguar más de el, veía videos, me compré libros, leía mucho en internet y me di cuenta que necesitaba que mi práctica fuera guiada por un profesional completo en el área, ahí decidí a ingresar a una escuela de Yoga Iyengar, rico pero muy relajado para mi personalidad, estuve ahí hasta mi gran lesión (más adelante hablaré de ese episodio de mi vida) y ahora estoy en una nueva escuela, especializada en el Yoga Ashtanga mi pasión.\r\n\r\nLa verdad no me imagino mi vida sin deporte o sin el Yoga.

Cuando prácticas estos deportes quemas calorías durante el entrenamiento pero, una vez terminado dejas de quemar, por el contrario, cuando levantas pesas, quemas calorías cuando entrenas y continuas hasta dos días después de realizado el entrenamiento. Esto se debe a que el cuerpo utiliza más calorías para reponerse de los micro desgarros que provoca el levantamiento con peso. Así es que incluye 2-3 días a tu rutina actual para ayudar a tener unos abs envidiables.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNO ESTÁS DURMIENDO LAS HORAS NECESARIAS\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSi te dejas atrapar por esa película de Netflix antes de dormir, probablemente no logres descansar mas de 7-8 horas diarias que es lo recomendado, es fundamental que nuestro sueño sea regulado al momento de iniciar nuestro entrenamiento.\r\n\r\n¿Sabías que el hambre extrema se debe a la falta de sueño? La falta de sueño causa la liberación de una hormona llamada Grelina, que es una estimuladora del apetito. Entonces para que no te pase esto, lee un libro para que puedas dormir con la mente descansada sin el procesamiento de imágenes.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nESTÄS CONSUMIENDO DEMASIADO SODIO\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAl igual que el exceso de azúcar en tu dieta es dañino, el sodio también. Una porción de papas fritas puede llegar a contener 1.550 mg de sodio (¡demasiado!), esto te causará hinchazón abdominal y retención de líquido. Cuando el deseo de sal te invada, unas ramitas de apio te ayudarán a controlar  esa sensación, son naturales y aparte, tu cuerpo requiere de más calorías para digerirlo de lo que te aportan.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBEBER ALCOHOL\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReduce o corta la ingesta de bebidas alcohólicas, eventualmente una copita de vino o champaña no te causara hinchazón abdominal, pero si su consumo es frecuente y además eres fanática de los tragos preparados, pues te digo, todo ese esfuerzo de la semana se verá perjudicado por estas bebidas.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNO EJERCITAS LO SUFICIENTE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSi ves que tu entrenamiento ya no te cuesta “sudor y lágrimas” pues es un indicio de que probablemente no estas realizando tu rutina con la correcta intensidad, tu cuerpo lo dirá y te darás cuenta de que es necesario aumentar la intensidad de esta.\r\n\r\nAhora que tienes claro algunos de los errores que puedes estar cometiendo, ¿estás lista para tener los abdominales soñados? .

Cuando prácticas estos deportes quema calorías durante el entrenamiento pero, una vez terminado dejas de quemar, Por el contrario, cuando levantas pesas, quemas calorías cuando entrenas y hasta dos días después de realizado el entrenamiento. Esto se debe a que el cuerpo utilizas más calorías para reponerse de los micro desgarros que provoca el levantamiento con peso.

Cuando el deseo de sal te invada, unas ramitas de apio te ayudarán a controlar  esa sensación, son naturales y aparte, tu cuerpo requiere de más calorías para digerirlo de lo que te aportan.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBEBER ALCOHOL\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReduce o corta la ingesta de bebidas alcohólicas, eventualmente una copita de vino o champaña no te causara hinchazón abdominal, pero si su consumo es frecuente y además eres fanática de los tragos preparados, pues te digo, todo ese esfuerzo de la semana se verá perjudicado por estas bebidas.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNO EJERCITAS LO SUFICIENTE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSi ves que tu entrenamiento ya no te cuesta “sudor y lágrimas” pues es un indicio de que probablemente no estas realizando tu rutina con la correcta intensidad, tu cuerpo lo dirá y te darás cuenta de que es necesario aumentar la intensidad de esta.\r\n\r\nAhora que tienes claro algunos de los errores que puedes estar cometiendo, ¿estás lista para tener los abdominales soñados? .

(597, 2, '2014-12-22 19:34:25', '2014-12-22 19:34:25', '¿Te gustaría saber por qué no puedes perder esa grasa abdominal? ¿Aún entrenando a diario y comiendo sano? Pones todo tu empeño y esfuerzo pero sientes que no puedes salir adelante. Entonces lo que necesitas es saber si realmente estas comiendo adecuadamente. Con esto  me refiero a comer frutas, verduras y proteínas magras. Te dejo algunas razones por la que te cuesta combatir la grasa abdominal y cómo puedes ganarle!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCOMER MUCHO DE NOCHE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSe convirtió en una regla el festín antes de dormir? Bueno desde ya te digo que es malísimo. Nuestro organismo se está preparando para entrar en una etapa de relajo y por lo tanto no tendrá tiempo de quemar estas calorías. Entre 20:00 y 21:00 hrs es ideal que sea nuestra ultima comida del día, y cargada en verduras, pueden ser crudas o cocidas sólo debes poner tu imaginación a volar.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSIN LEVANTAMIENTO DE PESAS\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHaces interminables horas de cardio pero aún no logras que se marquen los abdominales? Pues la razón es que una vez que terminas el cardio tu cuerpo paro de quemar calorías, a diferencia de cuando entrenas con pesas, ya que el cuerpo continua quemando calorías aún terminado el entrenamiento. Esto se debe a que la elevación de pesas produce micro desgarros que para reponerse de ellos, nuestro cuerpo consume mas calorías. Si incluyes 2-3 días de levantamiento de pesas ya verás aparecer esos Abs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nESCATIMAR TUS HORAS DE SUEÑO\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n¿Sabías que  tu hambre extrema se debe a la falta de sueño?

Te dejo algunas opciones que podrán resultarte entretenidas\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVOLEYBALL PLAYERO\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSi vas a la playa, este deporte te ayuda a conseguir un ritmo cardíaco adecuado, hacer amigos,  tonificar las piernas, los hombros, y glúteos. Y debido a que es más difícil moverse en la arena, se obtiene la quema de calorías extra.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 272 aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJARDINEAR\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWow !! Quemar calorías mientras haces tu jardín más hermoso, es increíble. Aquí nos encontramos constantemente flexionando nuestras rodillas y en cuclillas para llegar a las plantas. Es ideal para los glúteos, y tu jardín será la envidia de tus vecinos.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 136 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSURFEAR\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSimplemente jugar en las olas te permite quemar calorías incluso mientras te refrescas. Para obtener un mejor entrenamiento, asegúrate de remar duro para aumentar tu ritmo cardíaco.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 102 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTENNIS\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAgarra una raqueta y desafia a una amiga (o), vecina (o), o novio de un partido de tenis. Correr alrededor de la cancha te permite ejecutar una sesión de ejercicios aeróbicos. Además, golpear la pelota es excelente tóner para los brazos.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 272 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBYCYCLING\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAndar en bicicleta puede ser una gran manera de conseguir la quema de calorías, así como para tonificar los cuádriceps y los isquiotibiales. Un paseo quema más calorías que caminar y si subes un cerro mantendrás tus piernas jóvenes.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 204 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nROLLER PATINAJE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSaca tus patines y deslízate por el cemento para una sesión de cardio que también tonificará tus piernas, las caderas y  glúteos. Además, cuanto más rápido vayas, mejor será la brisa.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 168 calorías (a un ritmo pausado, de 8 mph) aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTURISMO\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFuera de la ciudad y no hay gimnasio? Ve los lugares de interés turístico a pie por las calles de cualquier ciudad o pueblo que estes visitando. Cuando sea posible, súbe los cerros y vas a  endurecer los músculos isquiotibiales y glúteos.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 129 calorías (3,5 ritmo mph) aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBUCEAR\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSi tienes la suerte de tener unas vacaciones tropicales, haz un tiempo para este ejercicio emocionante y revelador. Y si el buceo no es tu fuerte, o te asustan las profundidades, puedes practicar el snorkel. Te permite quemar 170 calorías en la misma cantidad de tiempo.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 238 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKAYAK\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUna excursión en kayak es una manera única de explorar el entorno en que te encuentras y de forma aparentemente eficaz para trabajar en tu six-pack.

Te dejo algunas opciones que podrán resultarte entretenidas\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVOLEYBALL PLAYERO\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSi vas a la playa, este deporte te ayuda a conseguir un ritmo cardíaco adecuado, hacer amigos,  tonificar las piernas, los hombros, y glúteos. Y debido a que es más difícil moverse en la arena, se obtiene la quema de calorías extra.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 272 aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJARDINEAR\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWow !! Quemar calorías mientras haces tu jardín más hermoso, es increíble. Aquí nos encontramos constantemente flexionando nuestras rodillas y en cuclillas para llegar a las plantas. Es ideal para los glúteos, y tu jardín será la envidia de tus vecinos.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 136 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSURFEAR\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSimplemente jugar en las olas te permite quemar calorías incluso mientras te refrescas. Para obtener un mejor entrenamiento, asegúrate de remar duro para aumentar tu ritmo cardíaco.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 102 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTENNIS\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAgarra una raqueta y desafia a una amiga (o), vecina (o), o novio de un partido de tenis. Correr alrededor de la cancha te permite ejecutar una sesión de ejercicios aeróbicos. Además, golpear la pelota es excelente tóner para los brazos.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 272 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBYCYCLING\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAndar en bicicleta puede ser una gran manera de conseguir la quema de calorías, así como para tonificar los cuádriceps y los isquiotibiales. Un paseo quema más calorías que caminar y si subes un cerro mantendrás tus piernas jóvenes.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 204 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nROLLER PATINAJE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSaca tus patines y deslízate por el cemento para una sesión de cardio que también tonificará tus piernas, las caderas y  glúteos. Además, cuanto más rápido vayas, mejor será la brisa.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 168 calorías (a un ritmo pausado, de 8 mph) aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTURISMO\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFuera de la ciudad y no hay gimnasio? Ve los lugares de interés turístico a pie por las calles de cualquier ciudad o pueblo que estes visitando. Cuando sea posible, súbe los cerros y vas a  endurecer los músculos isquiotibiales y glúteos.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 129 calorías (3,5 ritmo mph) aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBUCEAR\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSi tienes la suerte de tener unas vacaciones tropicales, haz un tiempo para este ejercicio emocionante y revelador. Y si el buceo no es tu fuerte, o te asustan las profundidades, puedes practicar el snorkel. Te permite quemar 170 calorías en la misma cantidad de tiempo.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 238 calorías aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKAYAK\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUna excursión en kayak es una manera única de explorar el entorno en que te encuentras y de forma aparentemente eficaz para trabajar en tu six-pack. Para avanzar hacia adelante, tienes que torcer tu torso como un resorte, además exige bastante fuerza en tus brazos el remo.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 179 aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSTAND-UP PADDLEBOARDING (SUP)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEl equilibrio sobre una tabla que flota en el agua puede parecer difícil, pero en realidad es bastante fácil una vez que subes a ella. Remar tonifica los bíceps y tríceps y espalda.\r\n\r\nCalorías quemadas: 200 aprox.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYa saben, son deportes para practicar solos o con tu grupo de amigos, pero no te crees excusas para no hacer nada durante tus vacaciones.

"Reebok cree que al esforzarnos al máximo y al poner a prueba nuestras limitaciones tenemos el poder de transformarnos no sólo físicamente, sino también mental y socialmente", dijo Matt O’Toole, Reebok Brand President.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n"Al adoptar este estilo de vida formas parte de una comunidad de personas unidas por un propósito en común: ser mejores versiones de sí mismos. Estamos convencidos de que cuando nos exigimos al máximo no sólo trasformamos nuestros cuerpos, trasformamos nuestras vidas por completo."\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRodrigo Guzmán, Brand Director de Reebok Andina dice, “Hay una nueva especie de atleta. Son las personas comunes y corrientes y esos son los atletas que el mundo debería tener como modelo a seguir. Para estos individuos, los logros no vienen de grandes sueldos ni medallas de oro: vienen de comprender que están transformando sus vidas a través del fitness, y que en el proceso están trasformando la vida de sus comunidades. Reconocemos y rendimos homenaje a estos nuevos atletas que se esfuerzan día a día en busca de obtener mejores recompensas, y en Chile vemos que hay cada vez más personas que adoptan este estilo de vida, y lo celebramos”.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLa campaña se lanzó con un video mundial, representando lo que realmente significa “Be more Human” que es superar retos, convertirnos en mejores líderes, convertirnos en seres humanos más capaces y mejores.

(701, 2, '2015-02-04 15:07:17', '2015-02-04 15:07:17', '“Be more Human” es la frase de lanzamiento de la nueva campaña de Reebok. Un identificador concepto que sin duda alguna nos reconoce a varios. Más de alguno tenemos a un cercano que encaja en esta frase. Cuando vi el video pude sentirme completamente identificada. Atletas que dentro de su vida normal logran hacerse el tiempo siempre para poder generar cambios completos en su cuerpo y mente, es incorporar el fitness como un estilo de vida y no un cambio de hábito pasajero.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEsta campaña busca celebrar y motivar el esfuerzo que hacen día a día miles de atletas en el mundo que con sus entrenamientos ya sean de Crossfit, Spartan Race o Body combat entre otros-, logran transformar vidas y así convertirnos en personas fuertes y mejores. "Reebok cree que al esforzarnos al máximo y al poner a prueba nuestras limitaciones tenemos el poder de transformarnos no sólo físicamente, sino también mental y socialmente", dijo Matt O’Toole, Reebok Brand President.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n"Al adoptar este estilo de vida formas parte de una comunidad de personas unidas por un propósito en común: ser mejores versiones de sí mismos. Estamos convencidos de que cuando nos exigimos al máximo no sólo trasformamos nuestros cuerpos, trasformamos nuestras vidas por completo."\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRodrigo Guzmán, Brand Director de Reebok Andina dice, “Hay una nueva especie de atleta. Son las personas comunes y corrientes y esos son los atletas que el mundo debería tener como modelo a seguir. Para estos individuos, los logros no vienen de grandes sueldos ni medallas de oro: vienen de comprender que están transformando sus vidas a través del fitness, y que en el proceso están trasformando la vida de sus comunidades. Reconocemos y rendimos homenaje a estos nuevos atletas que se esfuerzan día a día en busca de obtener mejores recompensas, y en Chile vemos que hay cada vez más personas que adoptan este estilo de vida, y lo celebramos”.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLa campaña se lanzó con un video mundial, representando lo que realmente significa “Be more Human” que es superar retos, convertirnos en mejores líderes, convertirnos en seres humanos más capaces y mejores.

(742, 2, '2015-02-16 14:16:08', '2015-02-16 14:16:08', 'Hace ya 3 meses atrás viví el viaje mas inolvidable y que sin duda marcará mi vida. Cuando comencé en el tema de vida saludable de la mano redescubrí el Yoga, al principio sólo era Yoga de gimnasio pero después necesite interiorizar mas, primero Iyengar y luego Ashtanga la disciplina de la cual me enamoré.\r\n\r\nEmpecé mi practica en la escuela de Loreto Correa, no necesite mucho tiempo para saber que era a lo que me quería dedicar. Averigüé donde podría estudiar Yoga en Chile (Ashtanga particularmente) y no lograba dar con ni una escuela que me entregara lo que andaba buscando, fue ahí cuando tomé la decisión de ir a estudiar Yoga a la cuna del Yoga, India  especificamente a Mysore de donde proviene el Ashtanga.\r\n\r\nLuego de averiguar en muchas lugares y sus sus programas, di con una que me lleno completamente, tenía materias como meditación, dieta ayurvédica, anatomía, etc. Era muy completo.\r\n\r\nMe caracterizo por ser muy enfocada en lo que hago así que me enfoque en mi viaje, junte todos mis días de vacaciones en mi trabajo y volé a India para certificarme como instructora en un YTTC. (Yoga teacher training course) que son cursos que se imparten en Asia en un tipo de programa mega intensivo y están avalados por la Yoga Alliance Usa o Yoga Alliance UK, el mio estaba acreditado por ambas.\r\n\r\nLlegué un sábado y las clases comenzaban ese mismo lunes, mi jet lag aún hacia estragos en mi cuerpo y todavía no podía creer lo que estaba viviendo, estaba sola al otro lado del mundo, en otro mundo, un lugar que no se puede describir con palabras.\r\n\r\nEstuve en clases por 4 semanas de lunes a sábado (sólo "libre" los domingos) había mucho que estudiar. La práctica comenzaba a las 5:30 am hasta 18:30 que terminábamos con meditación, teníamos 1.30 hrs de almuerzo, fue un mes intensivo en donde conocí un montón de gente linda de muchas partes del mundo, donde me probé a mi y desafíe mis miedos, una experiencia que si alguien esta pensando en vivirla, no lo dude y hágalo ya, yo lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados. Espero en mi corazón volver.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0131-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-753 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0131-copy.jpg" alt="DSC_0131 copy" width="1200" height="745" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0114-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-751 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0114-copy.jpg" alt="DSC_0114 copy" width="1200" height="795" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/121.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-743 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/121.jpg" alt="12" width="1200" height="900" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0118-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-752 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0118-copy.jpg" alt="DSC_0118 copy" width="1200" height="795" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1509153_10152917974042578_5561100524852016495_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-744 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1509153_10152917974042578_5561100524852016495_n.jpg" alt="1509153_10152917974042578_5561100524852016495_n" width="1200" height="1200" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_0892.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-748 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_0892.jpg" alt="IMG_0892" width="2448" height="3264" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_0941.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-749 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_0941.jpg" alt="IMG_0941" width="1200" height="1600" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1932386_10152943296467578_8739477222833956338_n-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-745 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1932386_10152943296467578_8739477222833956338_n-copy.jpg" alt="1932386_10152943296467578_8739477222833956338_n copy" width="1200" height="799" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0135-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-747 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_0135-copy.jpg" alt="DSC_0135 copy" width="1200" height="795" /></a>', 'MI PRIMER YTTC YOGA ASHTANGA', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'mi-primer-yttc-yoga-ashtanga', '', '', '2015-02-16 17:35:33', '2015-02-16 17:35:33', '', 0, 'http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/?p=742', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Presiona las espinillas y la parte superior de los pies firmemente contra el suelo.\r\nColoca tus manos en la región cordial\r\nInclina el tronco y arquéalo hacia atrás todo lo que puedas\r\nSuelta los brazos y coloca tus manos en los talones, con el tronco arqueado y la cabeza hacia atrás. Si las manos no te llegan a los pies, deja los brazos sueltos, evitando hacer un esfuerzo excesivo. Mantén durante 3-5 respiraciones profundas inhalando y exhalando por la nariz.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/yoga6.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-801 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/yoga6.jpg" alt="yoga6" width="1200" height="750" /></a>\r\n\r\nARDHA CHAKRASANA o MEDIA RUEDA\r\n\r\nÉsta asana parece dolorosa, pero no es tan difícil como parece. Comienza recostada sobre tu espalda, pero luego dobla las rodillas. Ahora, levanta la pelvis tan arriba como sea posible. Dobla la columna vertebral, que es lo que va a ayudar a hacer que se vuelva más flexible. Mantén durante 3-5 respiraciones profundas inhalando y exhalando por la nariz.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/yoga7.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-802 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/yoga7.jpg" alt="yoga7" width="3264" height="1664" /></a>\r\n\r\nEl yoga no sólo te hará más flexible y tonificará tu cuerpo, sino que también relajará tu mente.

La cantidad de veces que presionemos el PUMP varia netamente de cada tipo de pie.\r\n\r\nA diferencia de un calzado para <em>running</em> tradicional, que por lo general está compuesto por más de 40 partes individuales, el <strong><em>ZPump Fusion</em></strong> está hecho con sólo tres partes clave, lo que significa que no tiene componentes rígidos que restrinjan el movimiento del pie. Cada una de éstas trabaja en conjunto para proporcionar ajuste y control mejorados:\r\n\r\n<strong>La tecnología The Pump™</strong> – La revolucionaria cámara de aire ligera y totalmente ajustable; que al presionar el P<em>ump</em>, rodea las formas y contornos únicos del pie para brindar un ajuste seguro y personalizado que permite alcanzar el máximo rendimiento.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong><strong>La funda de fusión</strong> – Es una funda elástica en cuatro direcciones que mantiene unidos los componentes clave del ZPump Fusion. Una funda de compresión ligera y sin costuras amolda la tecnología The Pump™ al pie de cualquier corredor para darle mejor control y confort al correr.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong><strong>Suela exterior Clase Z </strong>El rendimiento de alta velocidad en la planta del pie, fundamental en cualquier calzado para correr, es proporcionado por medio de la suela exterior Clase Z. Inspirada en neumáticos de alto rendimiento, las ranuras en los bordes y en la planta del pie proporcionan control y maniobrabilidad mejorados para que los corredores puedan arrancar, frenar y cambiar de dirección en un instante.\r\n\r\nCuando se activa el mecanismo The Pump™ en el talón del ZPump Fusion, el aire se canaliza a través de una válvula y entra en la cámara de aire, permitiendo que ésta se llene y se aferre a lo largo de la parte superior y el talón de una forma completamente personalizable, única para cada pie.

Con esta serie que te presentaré a continuación no tienes excusa. ¡Ya que no necesitarás de nada más que ganas para ejecutarla!. \r\n\r\nPuedes partir realizando dos round de 1 minuto en cada ejercicio, si es por pierna 1 minuto por c/u, trata de hacer la máxima cantidad que puedas cada minuto, pero no descuides la ejecución y tu postura. Con el tiempo puedes agregarle peso a tus tobillos y así aumentar tu músculo.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLIE SQUATS\r\n\r\nPárate con los pies ligeramente más ancho que tus cadera. Los dedos de tus pies deben apuntar hacia afuera en un ángulo de 45 grados, luego baja en cuclillas como si estuvieras a punto de sentarte en una silla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/111.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-983 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/111.jpg" alt="split suat" width="1024" height="747" /></a>\r\n\r\nPLIE JUMP SQUAT\r\n\r\nPárate de la misma forma que la sentadilla anterior, con tus manos juntas a la altura de tu mentón, baja en cuclillas y cuando vuelvas salta juntando tus pies y golpeando los talones en el aire después de la sentadilla. Como siempre, recuerda calidad no cantidad es importante. El mantenimiento de la forma correcta es esencial para trabajar los grupos musculares adecuados y evitar cualquier lesión.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOSTADA DE LADO (POR PIERNA)\r\n\r\nAcuéstate de lado y asegúrate que tu codo está justo debajo de tu hombro. Dobla la parte superior de la pierna por encima de tu pierna de abajo, mantén los pies flexionados y el glúteo apretado mientras levantas la pierna de abajo hacia.

Otra alternativa para realizar la patada de tijera es entrecruzar tus piernas de un lado a otro. Mantén tus pies en punta y realiza pequeñas patadas controladas para hacerlas mas efectivas.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/23.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-974 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/23.jpg" alt="2" width="1024" height="657" /></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUENTE CON PRESIÓN\r\n\r\nAcuéstate sobre tu espalda y dobla tus rodillas con tus piernas muy juntas, a continuación, levanta tus caderas hacia arriba y hacia abajo.

(1000, 2, '2015-03-20 17:03:33', '2015-03-20 17:03:33', 'Si estás entrando con todo en el mundo fitness, ya debes saber que verás resultados rápidos con una buena alimentación y dieta deportiva, a lo último me refiero con suplementos alimenticios, los cuales te ayudarán a tonificar y marcar mas rápido el anhelado body de revista que todas soñamos tener y que ojo!, No es imposible de lograr, pero como siempre digo a todas no llega solito, necesitamos trabajo diario, constancia, disciplina, paciencia y perseverancia.\r\n\r\nLos batidos de proteína siempre son asociados al sexo fuerte, al macho alpha, de hecho cuando la tomo después de mi entrenamiento en el gym, suelen mirarme un poco extraño. Pero dejemos atrás el mito del macho alpha porque nosotras también necesitamos, mas aún si entrenamos duro!.\r\n\r\nAntes de entrenar, nos cargamos con un shot de energía para una rutina dura de ejercicios y después de entrenar, nos ayuda a recuperar y mejorar el desarrollo del músculo.\r\n\r\nSi quieres ver ese abdomen marcarse, lo fundamental en tu dieta es proteína, muchos se ayudan de la envasada, pero también la puedes realizar en tu casa, cual Arnold o Rocky.

Sigue leyendo y descubre el maravilloso resultado de un día entero de un detox juice.\r\n\r\nEL MITO\r\n\r\nSabemos que necesitamos carbohidratos y proteínas para sobrevivir, por lo que ¿Debería ser mala una dieta de jugos detox?.Bueno, la verdad es que no nos vamos a morir con un día detox. Como cazadores naturales / recolectores, estamos diseñados para sobrevivir con una dieta de frutas y verduras. No estoy recomendando una eterna ingesta de meses en jugos detox, simplemente que dediquemos un día para descubrir los secretos de los jugos desintoxicantes.\r\n\r\nELIGE EL DÍA\r\n\r\nElige un día de la semana que le quieras dedicar al detox (ideal el FDS). Será mucho más fresco y más fácil si tienes una licuadora en casa en lugar de tomar jugos pre-hechos. Después, simplemente reemplaza cada comida, desayuno, almuerzo y cena, con un jugo hecho en casa. Y toma mucha agua y té de frutas para mantenerte hidratado entre jugos.\r\n\r\n¿QUÉ UTILIZAR?\r\n\r\nPodemos usar todo tipo de frutas y vegetales, esto dependerá de nuestra imaginación. Para la base podríamos usar manzanas y zanahorias y, a continuación, añadir frutas y verduras a gusto. Puedo recomendar la espinaca, que es alta en energía, así como los plátanos, paltas, pepino, apio y sandía. No tengas miedo de mezclar sabores; todas las frutas y verduras tienen propiedades maravillosas y diferentes todo dependerá de lo que andes buscando así que se valiente y experimenta.\r\n\r\nES UNA DESINTOXICACIÓN!\r\n\r\nEs sólo un día que estamos liberando y drenando nuestro cuerpo así que, es necesario que nos abstengamos por un día de todo tipo de comida que queramos ingerir, café o leche, sí podemos picar alguna fruta. Es sólo un día! Por lo que centrémonos en la curación de nuestro cuerpo y en las cosas buenas que obtendremos.\r\n\r\nLOS BENEFICIOS\r\n\r\nDespués de mi día de detox me sentí increíble, como me encanta tomar liquido no fue terrible y aparte que cada jugo que preparé me satisfacía bastante, sentí mi piel más limpia e incluso andaba con mucha energía.\r\n\r\n\r\n¿Quién no va a querer darle un regalito así a su cuerpo?, pues a mi me encanta!.Entonces, dedico un día al mes a una bebida natural que limpie mi cuerpo tanto por fuera como por dentro.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/aboutme.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1021 size-full" src="http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/aboutme.jpg" alt="aboutme" width="1200" height="794" /></a>', 'LOS DETOX JUICE Y SU REAL BENEFICIO', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'los-detox-juice-y-su-real-beneficio', '', '', '2015-03-25 14:00:33', '2015-03-25 14:00:33', '', 0, 'http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/?p=1020', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Como para todo en la vida existe una alternativa saludable, y en este caso reemplazando algunos ingredientes y agregando otros me quedó una receta totalmente saludable.\r\n\r\nAquí les dejo la receta para que puedan cumplir su antojo sin culpa.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ingredientes:</strong>\r\n\r\n-3/4 de tazas de avena\r\n-2 cucharadas de aceite de coco (lo venden en <a href="www.lachakra.cl%20">la chakra</a>) o pueden usar aceite normal\r\n-3 cucharadas de stevia (pueden comprar una que venden en bolsita especial para postres, está en todos los supermercados)\r\n\r\n<strong>Para la salsa de berries:</strong>\r\n\r\n-1 taza de berries congelados (puede ser una mezcla entre frutilla, arándanos y frambuesas o cualquiera a gusto)\r\n- stevia ( a gusto)\r\n-1 cucharada de semillas de chia\r\n\r\n<strong>Para el relleno:</strong>\r\n\r\n500g de ricotta\r\n-1 Yogurth natural light\r\n-3 Huevos\r\n-1 Cucharadita de estracto de stevia\r\n-4 chucharadas soperas de azúcar mascabado ( azúcar 100% integral), o 100 ml de miel.\r\n-jugo de medio limón\r\n-2 cuchardas soperas de Maizena\r\n-1 cucharadita de vainilla\r\n-1oo ml de leche vaporada\r\n\r\n<strong>Preparación:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Para la masa:</strong> Mezclar todos los ingrediente a mano o con batidora (con batidora es más fácil). Mezcla por separado en otro bowl los huevos y agrégalos a la masa poco a poco hasta tener una crema (3 minutos con la batidora). y agrega las cucharaditas de aceite de coco o vegetal.\r\n\r\nPresiona la masa hasta cubrir la base del molde. Vierte la crema que hiciste con el yogurth. Para eso simplemente tienes que mezclar todos los ingredientes hasta que quede todo junto y sin grumos.\r\n\r\nLleva al horno por 30 minutos a 180 grados. Lo sacas y esperas que enfríe un poquito y agregas la salsa de berries\r\nque es una mezcla de chia, berries y stevia.  Después lo llevas al refrigerador mientras en el horno está la masa con el relleno. Después de sacar tu cheesecake saludable del horno la primera parte de recién ahí le pones la salsa de berries encima.\r\n\r\nCon esta receta puedes compartir con tus amigas, o con quién tu quieras.

Lo bueno también es que como aumenta la sensación de saciedad, puedes comer en la mañana y después no sientes hambre durante la mañana, o antes de tu colación de media mañana, que recuerda que puede ser alguna fruta. Además de poder consumirla con yogurth, yo a veces se la agrego a mis ensaladas, y queda riquìsimo.\r\n\r\n<strong>LINAZA</strong>\r\n\r\nEstas semillas si que son las mejores. Ayudan a controlar el tránsito lento y aceleran el metabolismo, por lo que en esos días en que sientes la guatita un poco más pesada son ideales. Al igual que la chia, son versátiles y las puedes incluir en tus ensaladas, o bien en tu desayuno con un yogurth natural, alguna fruta de tu preferencia y unas semillas de linaza. Se los recomiendo es ¡riquísimo!.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZAPALLO</strong>\r\n\r\nLas semillas de zapallo al igual que las demás semillas tienen un importante porcentaje de fibra y ayuda a evitar la odiada por muchas mujeres, retención de líquidos.En particular esta semilla contiene omega 3 y ácido fólico. Y además estas semillas mágicas, tienen propiedades anti-inflamatorias. Para estas semillas, también las pueden consumir solas. En<a href="http://pipaseeds.cl/"> Pipa Seed</a> las venden mezcladas con especies y son muy ricas. Para estas semillas lo ideal es consumir de 1-2 cucharadas soperas al día.\r\n\r\nBueno, las dejo con estas semillas y ya les contaré cuando pruebe otras que tengo en vista. No se olviden que consumirlas diariamente tiene múltiples beneficios y además las pueden mezclar con lo que ustedes quieran.', 'LO QUE DEBES SABER DE LAS SEMILLAS ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1121-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-07 16:19:08', '2015-04-07 16:19:08', '', 1121, 'http://local.mediatrends/_Chicachic/htdocs-new/app/1121-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
